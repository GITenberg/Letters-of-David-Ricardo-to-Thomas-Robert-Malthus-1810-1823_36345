<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The following Letters are printed for the first time from
the original manuscripts, kindly lent for the purpose by
Colonel Malthus, C.B. The representatives of Ricardo have
been good enough to make search for the corresponding
letters of Malthus, but without success.</p>

<p>The Collection covers the whole period of the friendship
of the two men. What is of purely private interest (a very
small portion) has, as a rule, been omitted. There is seldom
any obscurity in the text; the handwriting of Ricardo is
clear and good. The earlier letters have no envelopes.
The breaking of the seal has frequently torn a page, and
destroyed a word or two. In two cases we have nothing
but the fragment of a letter. But fortunately the bulk of
the series has reached us in a complete state.</p>

<p>These Letters were evidently known to Empson and
MacCulloch, whose references to them are quoted in their
proper place. Other letters of Ricardo, as well as his
speeches in Parliament, are quoted here and there when
they illustrate the text or fill up a gap. The Correspondence
with J. B. Say is given at some length, as it is probably
little known to English readers.</p>

<p>The Outline of Subjects will be found to contain only
a bare sketch of the main positions taken up by Ricardo
against Malthus in these Letters. It could not fairly be
expanded into an account of both sides of the argument,
for, when we are within hearing of only one of the disputants,
we cannot with fairness believe ourselves to have
the whole case before us. We cannot accept his statement
of the terms of the discussion, for, though he had every
desire to be just to his opponent, his cast of mind was
so different that he can hardly be thought to have entered
into his opponent's views with perfect sympathy<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>These
Letters indeed show on almost every page how completely
the two economists differed in their point of view.
Beginning in a deep mutual respect, their acquaintance with
each other grew into a very close intimacy; but it was the
friendship of two men entirely unlike in mental character.
Ricardo admits that he had been deeply impressed by the
Essay on Population (p. 107), but thinks that Malthus is
apt to miss the true subject of political economy, the inquiry
into the distribution of wealth, and to confine himself to
production, of which nothing can be made (pp. 111, 175);
Malthus seems to his friend to have too strong a practical
bias (p. 96); instead of reflecting on the general principles
that determine (for example) the Foreign Exchanges, he
tries to get light from Jamaica merchants and City bullion
dealers (p. 3, cf. 12); he buries himself in temporary causes
and effects instead of looking to permanent ones (p. 127);
he gains his point by a definition instead of an argument
(p. 237) and, perhaps through the same practical bias, he is
too much absorbed in questions of his own College (p. 125),
and not eager enough for political reform (pp. 151, 152).
Malthus, Cambridge Wrangler and Haileybury Professor,
was free from any academical bias in favour of abstract
thinking; he had in fact little of the typical University
man except his love of boating (p. 158). Ricardo, a self-made
and largely a self-educated man<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> (though he had
neither the pride of the first nor the vanity of the second),
had no traditions that were not mercantile, and made a
large fortune on the Stock Exchange<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. But, in his thinking,
he was under no slavery to details; he was even conscious
of a strong theoretical bias (p. 96). He was fonder
of 'imagining strong cases' to elucidate a principle, than of
adducing actual incidents to establish it (pp. 164, 167). The
very narrowness of his programme enabled him (as later it
enabled Cobden and his school) to seem to exhaust all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
difficulties of the subject, and dispose of them by plain
straightforward proofs. Malthus, who had a less acute
logical understanding, but saw more clearly the real breadth
and complexity of the subject, seemed often more faltering,
and less consistent with himself.</p>

<p>Ricardo agreed with his friend in looking, on the whole,
at the bright side of things, and forecasting prosperity for
England even in the dark days of Luddites and Six Acts
(pp. 139, 141). They were, both of them, unready writers,
partly from deference to each other's criticism (pp. 20, 23,
117, 125, 155, 159, 207),&mdash;partly, in Ricardo's case, from
awkwardness in composition, where he was always, in his
own opinion, the worse man of the two (pp. 104, 108, 145,
208),&mdash;partly because the obscurity of the subject was
felt by them to be inconsistent with dogmatic certainty
(pp. 111, 176, 181). But they are free in their criticism;
they never dream of allowing it to affect their good temper
(pp. 175, 240), and they are never afraid to confess mistakes
(pp. 20, 184, 207, 231, etc.).</p>

<p>Personally, they agreed in enjoying society and travel, in
loving 'law and order' and hating 'a row' (pp. 64, 208),
and in being nowhere so happy as in their family circle, in
Ricardo's case a patriarchally large one (p. 146). The robust
health of Malthus was not shared by his friend (p. 140), but
the latter had more of the qualities of a public man, and
in the House of Commons he was by no means a silent
member. Their range of interests was perhaps equally
wide, though Ricardo's bent was to natural science as
Malthus' to mathematics. In politics they were both in
favour of Parliamentary Reform. Francis Place<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, writing
in 1832 to a correspondent who had reproached Political
Economists with hostility to reform, says that the study
tends almost necessarily to political enlightenment, and
points to Malthus, Mill, Ricardo, and others in confirmation.
'Mr. Malthus' (he says) 'was an aristocratic parson when
he first published his Essay on Population ... but in going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
on with his work and being obliged to study political
economy, his prejudices gave way before principles, and he
became the advocate so far as he dared of good government.
His work contains irrefragable arguments for universal
suffrage, which cannot be overlooked, but must be applied
by every reader who understands the subject; and there
are also in his work other indications of what you and
I should call liberal principles<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.' For myself, Place adds,
I have been 'a plain Republican for forty years;' James
Mill is 'as bad as myself.' As to Ricardo: 'He was one of
the most enlightened of reformers I ever knew; he was a man
who never concealed his opinions.' There is no doubt,
from all the evidence, what these opinions were. Ricardo
advocated a widely extended suffrage, frequent parliaments,
and especially secret voting. In his speeches in the House
of Commons, which are more than a hundred in number,
from the first on the 25th March, 1819, to the last on the
4th July, 1823, he speaks his mind plainly not only on the
Bank, the Sinking Fund, the currency, agriculture, the
Poor Law, and the tariff, but on the reform of Parliament,
retrenchment, freedom of the press and right of public
meeting. His oratory seems in many respects to have
resembled that of Cobden. The arguments were given
with plain directness without elegance of diction; and they
were brought home by matter-of-fact similes from every-day
life or commercial experience. We know from Brougham
that his manner of speaking was earnest, modest, genial,
frank, and unaffected; and, as he only spoke on what he
knew, he was always heard with attention<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, though his
sentiments were unpalatable and he was usually in a
hopeless minority.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span></p>

<p>Bentham claimed to be the spiritual grandfather of
Ricardo<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, and Ricardo may have got his first thoughts on
Politics from him and Mill, as on Economics from Adam
Smith; he may also have caught from Bentham his habit of
reasoning abstractly. But the arguments he uses on behalf
of his political opinions are such as to leave the impression
that he reached his politics through his political economy,
the former being only the latter from a different point of
view. He seems to construct his notion of a free government
on the lines of his notion of a free trade. When he takes
the unpopular side in the case of the Carliles<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, imprisoned for
blasphemous libel, he is not unfairly described by Wilberforce
as simply 'carrying into more weighty matters those
principles of free trade which he has so successfully expounded'
in other cases. His interest in popular education
seems to spring from the desire that our people may be
rightly equipped for industrial competition. He attends
a City dinner to the Spanish Minister at a time when the
European Powers are threatening Spain, and appeals to
the principle of Non-Intervention<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, thus anticipating the
Manchester School and applying <i>laissez faire</i> on the large
scale. He applies the same principles perhaps too abstractly
in the case of the Spitalfield Acts<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, which made the wages
of the silkweavers to be fixed by the Justices instead of
by the 'higgling of the market,' and in the case of the
Truck System<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, or payment of wages in kind; but there was
much to justify his hostility to the first, and there was
Robert Owen's successful use of something very like the
Truck system in New Lanark to excuse his defence of the
second. He had a statesman's willingness to accept part
where he could not get the whole, and to welcome a
compromise rather than no progress at all. He would
not abolish the Corn Laws at a stroke, but would prepare
our agriculturists for the change by lessening the duty
on imports year by year till nothing was left but 10<i>s.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
a quarter, to remain as a 'countervailing duty' roughly
equal in amount to the peculiar burdens of the British
agriculturist<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. Some of his opponents called him a 'mere
theorist'; but this is a common taunt of men who cannot
render a reason against men who can. Even his disciple
MacCulloch thinks that his investigations were 'too abstract
to be of much practical utility<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.' But in his own hands
they were not so abstract that they were divorced from
practice, or unmodified by the needs of each case.
Such measures as he recommended in the House were of
great practical utility, and have nearly all been embodied
in subsequent legislation; yet he founded them all on
certain general principles which in the order of his thinking
were economical first and political afterwards. As far
as politics are concerned, we find the principles abstract
simply because they are not in our own day the principles
most needed in legislation.</p>

<p>In short, Ricardo's thinking was abstract only in the
sense in which Bentham's was so. They had arrived, by
a different road, at the same political philosophy. Ricardo
had a fixed idea of the individual as being logically prior
to society; and the interest of the community only meant
to him the interest of a large number of individuals, the
collection as a whole having no qualities not possessed by
each of the parts, and there being no spiritual bond.
Nature (which means in this case theory instead of history)
begins and ends with individuals; Nature made the individuals,
and Man made the groups. Ricardo agreed with
Bentham that 'the community is a fictitious Body, composed
of individual persons who are considered as constituting,
as it were, its Members. The interest of the community
then is what? The sum of the interests of the several
members who compose it<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.' We find Ricardo arguing: 'Let
me know what the state of men's interests is, and I will tell
you what measures they will recommend;' and 'that State<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
is most perfect in which all sanctions concur to make it the
interest of all men to be virtuous,' in other words, to promote
the general happiness<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.  Now, to consider human
beings as first and chiefly separate from one another and
having a separate self-interest which rules their action, is
certainly to reason abstractly.  But this abstract reasoning
of the Philosophical Radicals is due, in the case of the Economists
among them, more to Adam Smith than to Bentham.
Most of them, like Ricardo, had got not only their first
economics but their first lessons in thinking, from the
'Wealth of Nations.'  The 'Wealth of Nations' bore the
stamp of that Individualism which we usually associate
with Rousseau. Its author had written, seventeen years
before, a book in which he gave almost exclusive consideration
to the common bond that unites man to man, the
power one man has of putting himself by thought in the
place of another, or (in a wide sense of the word) to
sympathy. There is no need to suppose that Adam Smith
had forgotten or recanted the 'Moral Sentiments;' but it
is certainly the case that in the later and greater work,
which became the text-book of Political Economy, he
deliberately takes up another point of view, and presents
men as dominated by private interest. With every allowance
for his frequent qualifications ('upon the whole,' 'in
many respects,' etc.), there is no doubt that he there considers
'the natural effort which every man is continually making
to better his own condition' as a principle of growth and
health which owes little or nothing to State or Society, but
is continually transforming them and bringing good out of
their evil. He is fully aware how industry in all its
forms has been affected by the government and civilization
of a people; but he regards industry itself, or the
commercial ambition of the industrious classes, as more
potent still. As far as industrial progress is concerned, he
would have said with Bentham that Nature begins and
ends with individuals; in matters of trade he has no
confidence in associations of men, even when they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
voluntary. To him, the really beneficent association is that
unintended and unpreventible organization resulting from
the division of labour, the separation of trades, and the
uncontrolled movements of commercial ambition on the
part of individual men. He is careful to say that Political
Economy is not Politics<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>; but he insists that all political
restraints and preferences must be taken away from industry,
and 'the obvious and simple system of natural liberty'
will 'establish itself of its own accord.' It is not surprising
that this lesson in individualism was learned by his
successors without the cautions with which the teacher
would have surrounded it. The pupils unconsciously
argued as if political individualism was part and parcel of
economical principles, for it certainly seemed so in the one
book of their teacher that they had been led to study; and,
when Bentham made self-interest a leading principle of
politics, Ricardo, to follow him, needed only to make clear
to himself the underlying political basis of his economical
ideas. In Malthus, economical individualism is held in
check by a strong devotion to the principle of nationality,
as well as by a wide range of philosophical and general
interests. But to Ricardo political economy is all in all;
the ruling principles of all his thinking are determined for
him by the economical; and the result is individualism in
politics as well as in political economy. The animosity of
his critics is perhaps as often due to their strong dislike
of this political philosophy underlying his doctrines, and
derived through Adam Smith from Rousseau, as to any
real or supposed abstractness of the doctrines themselves.</p>

<p>Ricardo's political work has therefore the merits and the
defects of the theory of individualism and policy of <i>laissez
faire</i>, which crowned its achievements with the Repeal of
the Corn Laws and Navigation Acts. John Stuart Mill,
who was bred an individualist, has left us in his writings
a faithful reflection of the change which has passed over
English politics and English economics in the course of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
lifetime, and which he himself welcomed with some misgivings.
We have ceased to believe that the removal of
obstacles is enough to secure the highest good either in
government or in industry. But we must not deny that
the Manchester School and its predecessors were indispensable
in their own day.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that in addition to the faults of
his school, Ricardo had flaws of his own which were due
to a certain strong bias of self-interest<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. We might answer
that his arguments must none the less stand or fall by their
own logic. But there is no reason to suppose any bias in
Ricardo except his peculiar character of mind and cast of
thought. He had the intellectual interest of a reasonable
man in getting the right instead of the wrong answer to
a difficult question; and his selfish interest as a member
of the 'propertied' classes was not clear enough to be
a snare to him. 'It would puzzle a good accountant' (he
says in the House<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>) 'to make out on which side my interest
predominated; I should find it difficult myself from the
different kinds of property which I possess (no part funded
property) to determine the question.' He could be chivalrous
and even Quixotic on occasion. His best political friends<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
thought he was Quixotic when he proposed to levy a
high property tax to pay off the National Debt: 'I should
contribute any portion of my own property for the
attainment of this great end if others would do the same<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.'
There was chivalry in his praise of Cobbett's Letter to
the Luddites<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>; Cobbett had given him abuse unmixed
with any drop of generosity. We may therefore look in
vain in Ricardo for any feeling of antipathy to landlords or
any other body of men, though he spoke, as in duty bound,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
against landlords, bank directors, and all classes of monopolists,
whenever they stood in the way of urgent reforms.
Like other men, he not improbably had a lurking partiality
for what had been the main business of his working life.
But in his writings and speeches he gives us not feelings
but arguments, and arguments that cannot be dismissed
as feelings in disguise.</p>

<p>In the purely economical works there is more of abstract
theory than the author is ever fully aware. Not only did
he as an individualist habitually regard men as separate
competing atoms, and the desire of wealth as the permanent
and dominant motive of men<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>; but he made his general
statements too absolute. He sometimes guarded himself by
saying (as he does in these Letters): What I am laying down
is true over any considerable period of time; the
causes to which I point are permanent; I allow that other
causes may prevail for short intervals; temporary causes
may seem to overrule the permanent ones; but I look to the
final settlement. Nevertheless, he admitted more than once
in the course of his career that he had stated the permanent
causes too absolutely. The doctrine of Value is first presented
by him as extremely simple,&mdash;the value of a thing depends
on the labour employed in producing it. Then, as we go
on, we find this is only true of 'the early stages of society
before much machinery or durable capital is used,' while it
is not meant to be true, even there, of objects that have
a 'fancy' value, due purely to their scarcity. Next, we are
told that in modern times the relative value of two things
is affected by the proportions in which fixed capital and
circulating enter into their production; if fixed capital enters
more into one than into another, then a rise of wages will
lower the value of the first, for it will lower the rate of profits,
and, as there are more profits concerned in the first, the value
of this first will fall in relation to the other. This is not all;&mdash;if
two things are produced with a like amount of fixed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
capital, yet, if the durability of the capital is different, there
will be more labour where there is less durability, and more
profits where there is more durability; the things produced
by the more durable fixed capital will be lowered in value
by a rise in wages, which lowers the rate of profit; and so
on, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>. In short, value is affected not only
by labour, but by the wages of labour. To these concessions
we may add the important change of view, which (as we know
from these Letters) made MacCulloch tremble for the Ark of
his Covenant<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>; we had heard nothing at first but the praise
of machinery as lowering prices and increasing the general
wealth; now we are reminded that the invention of it may
for the time cause serious injury to the working classes<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<p>It is not difficult for men living two generations after
Ricardo, and having (as he himself expressed it<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>) 'all the
wisdom of their ancestors and a little more into the bargain,'
to point out many unjustified assumptions, many ambiguous
terms, and even many wavering utterances, in Ricardo's
'Principles,' in spite of their appearance of severe logic.
The author's detached practical pamphlets were in those
respects far more powerful than this volume of imperfectly
connected essays on general theory. The flattering importunities
of friends had induced an unsystematic writer to
attempt a systematic treatise<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. The cardinal doctrine, that
of Value, is applied to only one class of cases, and, even to
that, with serious modifications. It was left for later
economists, like Jevons in this country, and Menger and
B&ouml;hm Bawerk in Germany, to take up the task of giving a
theory of value that will embrace all cases of it, not excluding
those objects that possess a value 'wholly independent
of the quantity of labour originally necessary to produce
them, and varying with the varying wealth and inclinations
of those who are desirous to possess them<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span></p>

<p>Malthus has left a clear statement of the points at issue
between Ricardo and himself in the Quarterly Review
for January, 1824. He contended against Ricardo that
(1) Quantity of Labour is not the chief cause of Value, but
(2) 'Supply and Demand' are more truly so described, while
(3) Competition of Capital, and not fertility of the soil, determines
the rate of profits. But, in regard to the first, he
hardly gives Ricardo sufficient credit for his large concessions.
In regard to the second, he does not realize that
supply and demand are vague terms which can only be
made definite by a theory of value itself. In regard to the
third position, if fertility of soil be translated productiveness
of the staple industry, Ricardo's view seems nearer the
truth than his own. The inadequacy of the whole discussion
on this third head is largely due to the fact that
economists had not then been pushed by Socialism into a
thorough investigation of Profits and Interest. They were
content to borrow these ideas from every-day commercial
life, and treat them as given ultimate facts needing no
explanation. They therefore never fully accomplished the
very first task of Political Economy, to state the facts as
they are, and analyse into its fundamental laws the existing
industrial system of modern nations. Still less did they
fulfil its second task, to estimate the relation of the industrial
system to the larger social and political body in
which it lives and moves and has its being. The peculiar
wants and motives of an individual people, changing, as they
do, with the growth of civilization, must be viewed in their
effects upon the production and distribution of the national
wealth, if the truth about the latter is to be fully known.
It is because the older economists did not attempt this
that their discussions, carried on even by their most eminent
representative men, seem to later readers superficial and
unreal. But in their Economics, as in their Politics, they
had their own work and not ours to do; and we must not
blame them for not answering questions that have only
very recently occurred to ourselves.</p>

<h2><a name="OUTLINE_OF_SUBJECTS" id="OUTLINE_OF_SUBJECTS"></a>OUTLINE OF SUBJECTS.</h2>


<p>In only two cases do the letters of this collection form
groups that have a subject of their own not discussed at any
length in the other letters. Letters I to XIV are the only
ones that discuss at any length the influence of the Depreciation
of the Currency on the Foreign Exchanges. Letters
LXXVIII to LXXXVIII are the only ones that so discuss the
Measure of Value. After these the nearest approach to
continuity is perhaps in Letters LXXI to LXXVII, when
Over-production is the chief subject. But the discussion of
Rent, Wages and Profits is not conducted by chapters as in
a book; it follows the course of conversations which were
not recorded, and obeys suggestions that are given in replies
lost to us. We cannot hope to make the propositions on
these three heads fall into a consecutive logical series.</p>

<p>The following analysis of the letters is not meant to be
exhaustive. Ricardo's opinions on the Bank of England
(XXXV, etc.) and on the East India College (XL, etc.), for
example, will not be found in it. It is simply a statement
of the chief economical arguments.</p>

<p>In the early letters the correspondence turns chiefly on
matters made prominent at the time (1810 seq.) by the
Bullion Committee and Ricardo's own pamphlet, 'The High
Price of Gold Bullion.' Though this pamphlet did not
appear in its separate form till early in 1810, the matter of
it had been published by Ricardo in a series of letters to
the 'Morning Chronicle' beginning in September, 1809.
These letters brought their author into public notice, and
they seem to have led Malthus to seek his acquaintance.
The earliest letters (of which Letter I in this collection
was clearly not the first of the whole correspondence) were
naturally on the subjects that first brought the two men
together.</p>

<p>Ricardo's main positions as against Malthus are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. The amount of the currency of a nation is determined
for it not simply by its size and population but by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
nature and extent of its trading transactions; and yet,
when these elements are given, the currency of one nation
will stand to the currency of another in some ascertainable
normal proportion, to alter which is to alter the relative
value of the currencies affected (VI, VII, X).</p>

<p>2. Such events as a bad harvest, a change in articles of
consumption or the transmission of a subsidy abroad, will,
by altering the relative value of our currency, produce
effects on the exchanges which, apart from their own
specific remedy, are permanent, not transitory (I, VII, X).</p>

<p>3. An increase in the amount of gold and silver in a
country will lead to an increased use of these metals for
general purposes rather than to a proportionate fall in their
value, there (II, III).</p>

<p>4. An increase in the value of a nation's exports and
imports may involve no increase of its wealth or its capital,
but may be due to a mere change from one set of articles
of consumption to another, or to a carrying trade with
foreign capital (IV).</p>

<p>5. In any case, such an increase is not the cause, but the
effect of a change in the currency; it is a sign that money
is going from where it is cheap to where it is dear (IV, VI,
IX, cf. XII and XVII), and the Exchanges are an accurate
measure of the difference (VII).</p>

<p>6. There has certainly been an increase of wealth in our
own country in recent years, but it has not necessarily
been accompanied with an increased rate of profits (V,
cf. XX).</p>
</div>

<p>In Letters XV to XXI the following are the chief propositions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Restrictions on the importation of corn by keeping
up the price of necessaries have a tendency to lower profits
(XV), unless, indeed, they are followed by a great reduction
of capital (XVI, XVII).</p>

<p>2. The only cause of permanently high or low profits is
the facility of procuring necessaries, for on that mainly
depends the rate of wages (XVI, XVIII, XIX, XX, XXI, cf.
V, and for qualification LXXIX, LXXX).</p>

<p>3. Other causes, such as bad harvests, new taxation,
changes in demand, or excessive accumulation, are merely
temporary (XX, XXI, cf. Ricardo's Pol. Econ. and Tax.,
ch. vi. 'On Profits').<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span></p>

<p>4.  Improvements in agriculture or machinery by increasing
productiveness permanently increase profits (XX, cf.
V and XXIII).</p>
</div>

<p>To these may be added&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>5. Consumption and accumulation equally promote demand,
and are both of them ineradicable tendencies of our
nature, the one adding to our enjoyments, the other to our
power (XIX).</p>

<p>6. Accumulation increases not only production, but consumption
(XXI).</p>

<p>7. It is worth while to establish the truth of a principle,
even if we cannot establish its utility (XXI).</p>
</div>

<p>In Letters XXIII to LXVIII, and in LXXVIII to LXXX,
the positions are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. By importing cheap foreign corn the public saves the
whole difference in price (XXIII, XXIV).</p>

<p>2. It must be allowed that the prices of articles, besides
varying with the amount of necessary labour bestowed on
them, vary with the value of their raw material (XXV).</p>

<p>3. Apart from changes in the currency, a rise in the price
of corn and a fall in the corn wages of labour, would be a
contradiction (XXVI).</p>

<p>4. It follows from the principle of Population that the
rate, as distinguished from the amount, of agricultural
production, grows not greater, but less, when the increase
of population drives agriculture to the cultivation of poorer
soils (XXVII, XXVIII, cf. XLIX).</p>

<p>5. This means that the whole cost in corn will be greater
in proportion to the whole produce of corn, and, though the
whole cost in money may be less in proportion to the whole
produce in money, the rate of profits from farming will fall
(XXIX).</p>

<p>6. A tax on home corn raises prices twice over, and
should be accompanied by a countervailing duty, not necessary
in other cases (XXIX).</p>

<p>7. In order of time, the increased price of corn comes
first, and the costly cultivation second, but this increase of
farmers' profits may be due to a fall in general profits that
is itself caused by the increased price of corn (XXIX).</p>

<p>8. The progress of wealth has a tendency to lower profits
and increase rent (XXIX).</p>

<p>9. Mere increase in quantity of corn will not prevent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
increase in price if the numbers of consumers have increased
in equal or greater proportion. So it will be one day in
America (XXX).</p>

<p>10. A rise in the price of corn will not be followed by a
rise in the price of other commodities, but by a fall in
profits (XXXI, XXXIV, XXXV).</p>

<p>11. An addition of rich land to our island would reduce
the price of corn by reducing the cost of raising the total
supply of corn; and it would not raise the value of manufactured
goods (XXXII).</p>

<p>12. High prices, whether caused by depreciation of
money or by difficulty of production, are not a public
benefit; in the first case, they are a cause of distress,
especially to the working classes; in the second, they are
a sign but not a cause of prosperity (XXXIII, XXXIV).</p>

<p>13. Facility of production includes skill and appliances
as well as fertility of soil, and in that sense, when suddenly
introduced in a fertile country, it would for some time
extinguish rent (XXXVI).</p>

<p>14. There is no real distinction between productiveness
of industry and productiveness of capital; and in the progress
of society both of them will diminish, and rents will
increase (XXXVI).</p>

<p>15. Wages do not rise when labour is productive unless
the productiveness of the labour gives rise to a new capital
that demands new labour (XXXVII).</p>

<p>16. There can be no such demand for new labour unless
there is a reduction in the value of food (XXXVII).</p>

<p>17. The only permanent cause of diminished demand for
capital is the increased price of food (XXXVIII).</p>

<p>18. Low prices are not necessarily a discouragement to
production (XXXIX).</p>

<p>19. The need of cultivating less productive soils is the
cause of higher nominal and lower real wages (XLII), and
it is the only cause in constant and permanent operation
(XLVIII, cf. LXIX).</p>

<p>20. Profits depend on wages; wages on the supply and
demand of labour, and on the cost of the labourers' necessaries
(XLIX).</p>

<p>21. Profits will therefore rise if the last are easily produced,
unless through stationariness of population demand
for labour has increased (L).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span></p>

<p>22. In two lands with equal capital and equal population,
but with different fertility of soil, profits would differ in
favour of the more fertile (L).</p>

<p>23. The rate of interest is no sure indication of the rate
of profits; and a low rate of interest may co-exist with
a low rate of wages and a high rate of profits (LXIII).</p>

<p>24. Profits cannot be said to depend on 'the proportion
which capital bears to labour,' for, where profits were
lowest, most capital would be needed to produce a given
return, and, where highest, least, in proportion (LI).</p>

<p>25. By a rise in the value of money it is possible (though
not probable) that a reduced cost of labour, materials, and
machinery might be followed by an increase instead of
a reduction, in their money value (LXIII).</p>

<p>26. A dearth may increase profits and wealth by making
labour cheap (LXIII).</p>

<p>27. Free trade in corn may increase the amount of profits
more than a policy of Restriction may increase the amount
of Rents (LXVII, cf. LXX).</p>

<p>28. Rent is always a transfer, and never a creation of
wealth (LIII, LXVIII).</p>

<p>29. There cannot be two rates of profit at the same time
in the same country (LXXVIII), nor under free trade could
there be a very different rate in different countries, the cost
of necessaries and therefore the rate of wages being brought
nearly to a level, allowance being made for differences
between one country and another in regard to the standard
of living (LXXIX). It seems impossible that under free
trade a fertile country, unless agriculture were its sole and
only industry, and its capital were small, would long continue
to sell its corn at the high prices of its less favoured
rivals; the prices would fall to cost price (LXXX).</p>
</div>

<p>In Letter LXV, and in Letters LXIX to LXXVII, the
positions are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Natural Price should not be described as depending,
like Market Price, on Supply and Demand, for it can never
permanently fall below or rise above the expenses of production
(LXV).</p>

<p>2. A universal over-production is impossible (LXXII,
LXXVII), and a glut of particular articles may be cured by
a cessation in the production of those articles (LXXII);
a 'superior genius' might so lay out our capital even now,
that all might be prosperous (LXXIII).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>3. It is not demand, but supply, which regulates value,
and supply is itself determined by comparative cost of
production (LXXIII, LXXIV).</p>

<p>4. If all labour and capital were devoted to production
of necessaries, there might then be an over-supply or
general glut, of them; but in no other case is such a glut
possible (LXXIV, LXXVII).</p>

<p>5. Over-production tends to cure itself by destroying
profits, and thereby removing the producer's motive for
production. But production could not go on when this
point had been reached, and therefore the over-production
could not last (LXXVI).</p>

<p>6. The remedy would be not the greater consumption of
non-producers, but the payment of lower wages, which
means the securing of higher profits by the producers.
When wages are excessive, the labourers are the unproductive
consumers, and the employers who pay them are
thereby causing instead of curing the over-production
(LXXVI, LXXVII).</p>

<p>7. A diminished demand for labour may mean, not the
employment of fewer men, but the payment of lower wages
(LXXVII).</p>
</div>

<p>In Letters LXXVIII to LXXXVIII the positions are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. It is better to take, as a Measure of Value, some
foreign commodity [like gold], the cost of producing which
is nearly invariable, than to estimate either by the amount
of labour or by the amount of corn or of other goods
generally that will be purchased by the article measured
(LXXVII, LXXVIII).</p>

<p>2. There is nothing in the said labour which fits it to be
a better measure of value than anything else; but, on the
contrary, to use it as a measure is to involve ourselves in
paradoxes (LXXXIII, LXXXV to LXXXVIII).</p>

<p>3. There cannot be an absolute or universal measure of
value, for there is no uniformity in the conditions under
which commodities are produced, the time taken and the
proportion and durability of the capital employed being,
for example, very different (LXXXIV).</p>

<p class="ralign1"><span class="smcap">Stock Exchange</span>, <i>25th Feb., 1810</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="idt">I have just time, after a very busy day, to tell you
that I will endeavour to get Mr. Mushet<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> to meet you at
my house at breakfast on Sunday morning. At any rate
I shall expect you, and, if Mushet is engaged, I shall be
able to tell you whether he will meet us on Monday or
Tuesday in the City. He is exceedingly obliging, and
would I am sure not mind trouble if he could contribute
to throw light on the subject of exchanges, yet I think he
will not be inclined to publish anything under his own
name as he gave great offence to the higher powers on a
former occasion.</p>

<p>You have clearly stated the point of difference now
between us; I think we never so well understood each
other before. There are some causes which operate on
the exchange which are in their nature of transitory duration;
there are others which have a more permanent
character. If we agree that a change of taste in one
country for the commodities of the other,&mdash;and the transmission
of a subsidy will produce certain effects on the
exchange,&mdash;the only question between us is as to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
duration. I am of opinion that they will operate for a
very considerable time and that in fact recourse is not had
to bullion but as a last resort.</p>

<p>I cannot believe that you give a correct account of your
habits of application any more than you did of your
memory when I last saw you. From all my observations
I should have been led to the very opposite conclusions from
those which you have formed; and I believe most of your
friends would be of my opinion. When you have once fairly
begun, I expect that you will advance at a giant's pace.</p>

<p>I beg you to remember me kindly to Mrs. Malthus.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p class="ralign1"><span class="smcap">Stock Exchange</span>, <i>22 March, 1810</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="idt">Mrs. Ricardo is expecting Mrs. Malthus to accompany
her on Friday next to Knyvett's concert, and will, I
am sure, be very much disappointed at the information
which I am to give her that she will not be able to accompany
you to town. I will not however quite give up all
hopes of seeing her.</p>

<p>You must positively not think of leaving us before
Tuesday. I have engaged several of your friends to meet
you at dinner on Monday, and I not only advance my own
claims but those of Mr. Wishaw<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, Mr. Sharp<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, Mr. Tennant<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>,

<p>I have been making enquiries concerning a bullion
merchant. I find that the trade is mostly carried on by a
class of people not particularly scrupulous in their modes
of getting money, and I am told that they would not be
very communicative, particularly on the subject of their
<i>exports</i>. There are however some well-informed merchants
who know a great deal of the trade without themselves
being actively engaged in it, to whom I hope I shall be
able to introduce you.</p>

<p>I do not admit that if you were to double the medium of
exchange it would fall to half its former value, not even if
you were also to double the quantity of metal which was
the standard of such medium. The consumption would
increase in consequence of its diminished value, and the
fall of its value would be regulated precisely by the same
law as the fall in the value of indigo, sugar, or coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. Mushet will dine with us on Sunday. What do you
think of Mr. Vansittart's financial talents?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Speaking in the House of Commons on Agricultural
Distress, on May 7, 1822, Ricardo gives an illustration which bears on
some points in the foregoing and following letters: 'Suppose my own
case. I am possessed of a considerable quantity of land, the whole
unburthened with a single debt. Now according to the honourable
member (Mr. Attwood) I and the tenants on that land would have
only been injured to the amount of the increase which the change
in the value of money has made in the burthen of taxation; but
we are in point of fact injured much more.' 'The superabundant
supply' has caused a sinking in the value of corn greater than in
proportion to the additional quantity itself. To understand why,
take the case of a commodity introduced for the first time, say a
particular kind of superfine cloth: 'If 10,000 yards of this cloth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
were imported, under such circumstances, many persons would be
desirous of purchasing it, and the price consequently would be
enormously high. Suppose this quantity of cloth to be doubled;
the aggregate value of the 20,000 yards would be much more
considerable than the aggregate value of the 10,000 yards, for the
article would still be scarce and therefore in great demand. If
the quantity of cloth were to be again doubled, the effect would
still be the same, for, although each particular yard of the 40,000
would fall in price, the value of the whole would be greater than
that of the 20,000. But, if they went on in this way increasing
the quantity of the cloth until it came within the reach of the
purchase [<i>sic</i>] of every class in the country, from that time any
addition to its quantity would diminish the aggregate value. This
argument would apply to corn. Corn is an article which is
necessarily limited in its consumption, and, if you went on increasing
it in quantity, its aggregate value would be diminished
beyond that of a smaller quantity. I make an exception in favour
of money. If there were only &pound;100,000 in this country, it would
answer all the purposes of a more extended circulation; but, if the
quantity were increased, the value of commodities would alter
only in proportion to the increase, because there is no necessary
limitation of the quantity of money [wanted].' (Cf. Letter III,
p. 3.) So on June 12th he says: 'Quantity regulates the value
of everything,' though it is also true (he says in a speech of
May 9, 1822) 'that the price of every commodity is constituted
by the wages of labour and the produce [<i>sic</i>] of stock.'</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="idt">I have left you quite free for Friday, but I regret
that your engagements will not conveniently allow you
to come to us on that day. We shall expect you on
Saturday morning. I hope Mrs. Malthus' visit will not be
deferred longer than the next meeting of the King of Clubs<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.</p>

<p>It appears to me that you ascribe the difference in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
variations of price which would probably be the effect
of doubling the quantity of coffee, sugar, or indigo, on
[the] one hand, or of doubling the quantity of the precious
metals on the other, to a wrong cause. Coffee, sugar, and
indigo are commodities for which, although there would
be an increased use if they were to sink much in value,
still, as they are not applicable to a great variety of new
purposes, the demand would necessarily be limited; not
so with gold and silver. These metals exist in a degree
of scarcity, and are applicable to a great variety of <i>new</i>
uses; the fall of their price, in consequence of augmented
quantity, would always be checked, not only by an increased
demand for those purposes to which they had
before been applied, but to the want of them for entirely
new employments. If they were in sufficient abundance,
we might even make our tea-kettles and saucepans of
them. It is to this essential difference between these commodities,
and not to the circumstance of one of them being
employed as a circulating medium, that I should attribute
the different effects which would follow from the augmentation
of their quantity. In any point of view however
I do not see how it bears materially on the question
between us, namely whether the precious metals are frequently
resorted to for the payment of debts between
countries when no disturbance has taken place in the
amount or proportion of the currency.</p>

<p>I wonder as you do that the stocks have not felt the
effects of Mr. Vansittart's vigorous system. The delay
which has taken place in creating new stock, the good
news from abroad, and, above all, the want of reflection in
the mass of stockholders may be considered as the cause.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;'The King of Clubs' is described in the Life of Sir
James Mackintosh, (by his son,&mdash;2nd ed. 1836), vol. i. p. 137<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
(under date 1800): 'As an agreeable rallying point in addition
to the ordinary meetings of a social circle, a dinner-club
(christened "The King of Clubs" by Mr. Robert Smith
[Bobus, brother of Sydney Smith]), was founded by a party at
his [Mackintosh's] house, consisting of himself [Mackintosh]
and the five following gentlemen, all of whom still survive:&mdash;Mr.
Rogers, Mr. Sharp, Mr. Robert Smith, Mr. Scarlett, and
Mr. John Allen. To these original members were afterwards
added the names of many of the most distinguished men of the
time; and it was with parental pride and satisfaction that he
received intelligence some time after of their "being compelled to
exclude strangers and to limit their numbers, so that in what way
'The King of Clubs' eats, by what secret rites and institutions
it is conducted, must be matter of conjecture to the ingenious
antiquary, but can never be regularly transmitted to posterity by
the faithful historian."'&mdash;The biographer adds in a note that the
Club was suddenly dissolved in the year 1824. Some of the most
distinguished members are enumerated, among them Ricardo (l. c.
p. 138 <i>n.</i>). To judge by a letter of Mackintosh to Sharp on 29th
June, 1804, the Club at that date included (besides the writer and
his correspondent) only Sydney Smith, Scarlett, Boddington, the
poet Rogers, Whishaw, and Horner (Mack. Life, vol. i. 209). The
time of meeting seems to have been the first Saturday of every
month. See below Letter XLIV, but cf. XLIII. Add Memoirs

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="idt">On my return to London, after a short excursion to
Tunbridge Wells, I found your obliging letter.... On
further reflection I am confirmed in the opinion which I
gave with regard to the effect of opening new markets
or extending the old. I most readily allow that since the
war not only the nominal but the real value of our
exports and imports has increased; but I do not see how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
this admission will favour the view which you take of the
subject.</p>

<p>England may have extended its carrying trade with the
capital of other countries. Instead of exporting sugar and
coffee direct from Guadaloupe and Martinique to the continent
of Europe, the planters in those colonies may first
export them to England, and from England to the continent.
In this case the list of our exports and imports
will be swelled without any increase of British capital.
The taste for some foreign commodity may have increased
in England at the expense of the consumption of some
home commodity. This would again swell the value of our
exports and imports, but does not prove a general increase
of profits nor any material growth of prosperity.</p>

<p>I am of opinion that the increased value of commodities
is always the effect of an increase either in the quantity of
the circulating medium or in its power, by the improvements
in economy [in] its use [<i>sic</i>]<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>,&mdash;and is never the
cause<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. It is the diminished value, I mean nominal value,
of commodities, which is the great cause of the increased
production of the mines; but the increased nominal value
of commodities can never call money into circulation. It
is certainly an effect and not a cause. I am writing in a
noisy place; you must therefore excuse all blunders. I
must offer the same apology for my two half sheets<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. I

<p class="idt">... I cannot deny myself the pleasure of accepting
your kind invitation for Saturday next. I will be with
you at the usual hour.</p>

<p>That we have experienced a great increase of wealth
and prosperity since the commencement of the war, I am
amongst the foremost to believe; but it is not certain that
such increase must have been attended by increased profits,
or rather an increased rate of profits, for that is the question
between us. I have little doubt however that for a
long period, during the interval you mention<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>, there has
been an increased rate of profits, but it has been accompanied
with such decided improvements of agriculture
both here and abroad, for the French Revolution was
exceedingly favourable to the increased production of food,
that it is perfectly reconcileable to my theory. My conclusion
is that there has been a rapid increase of capital,
which has been prevented from showing itself in a low
rate of interest by new facilities in the production of food.
I quite agree that an increased value of particular commodities
occasioned by demand has a tendency to occasion
an increased circulation, but always in consequence of the
cheapness of some other commodities. It is therefore their
cheapness which is the immediate cause of the introduction
of additional money.</p>

<p>I have not been home since I received your letter. I
will look at the passage you refer me to in Adam Smith<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>,
and will consider of the other matters in your letter, so as
to be prepared to give you my theory when we meet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>The facts you have extracted from Wetenhall's tables
are curious<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, and are hardly reconcileable to any theory.
I attribute many of them to the state of confusion into
which Europe has been plunged by the extent and nature
of the war; and it would be quite impossible to reason
correctly from them without calculating what the state
was of the real as well as the computed exchange during
the periods referred to. Pray make my best respects to
Mrs. Malthus, and believe me,</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="idt">I lose no time in answering your obliging letter and
endeavouring as far as lies in my power to remove the very
few objections which prevent us from being precisely of the
same opinion on the subject of money and the laws which
regulate its value in the countries which have constant
commercial intercourse with each other. I have no view
in this discussion but that which you have avowed, the
circulation of truth; if therefore I should fail to convince
you, and you should express your opinions in print, it is
immaterial to me whether you mention my name or not.
I trust you will do that which shall most fully tend to
establish the just principles of the science.</p>

<p>There does not appear to me to be any substantial difference
between bullion and any other commodity as far as
regards the regulation of its value and the laws which
determine its exportation or importation. It is true that
bullion, besides being a commodity useful in the arts, has been
adopted universally as a measure of value and a medium of
exchange; but it has not on that account been taken out of
the list of commodities. A new use has been found for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
particular article; consequently there has been an increased
demand for it and an augmented supply. This new use
has made every man a dealer in bullion; he buys it to sell
it again, and the general competition of all these dealers
will as surely, and as strictly, regulate its value in every
country, as the competition of the same or other dealers
will regulate the value of all other commodities. I have
your sanction for calling every purchaser of commodities a
dealer in bullion; and, though in the language of commercial
men the sellers of money are in all cases called purchasers,
it is not on that account less true that they are
sellers of one commodity and purchasers of another. The
nature of corn was not changed by the discovery that a new
use might be made of it by fermentation and distillation;
and, if we should hereafter discover that it might be used
for a hundred other purposes, contributing to the comforts
and enjoyments of mankind, the demand for it would increase,
and its price would in the first instance be considerably
augmented; but this would be the only change it
would undergo; it would continue to be imported and exported
by the same rules as every other commodity. I
have no doubt that on this point we should not differ; it
remains therefore for you to show why the new uses, to
which gold has been applied in consequence of its being
adopted as the money of the world, should exempt it from
the general law of competition, and why it should not certainly
and invariably (invariably only as that term is applied
to other commodities) seek the most advantageous market.</p>

<p>It is probable that the word 'redundancy' has not been
happily chosen by me to express the impression made on
my mind of the cause of an unfavourable balance of trade;
but on looking over the article in the Review<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> I find that
you use it precisely in the sense in which I wish to convey
my meaning, for you admit that a relatively redundant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
currency may be, and frequently is, a cause of an unfavourable
balance of trade; but you contend that it is not the
only cause. Now I, so understanding the word, contend
that it is the invariable cause. This relative redundancy
may be produced as well by diminution of goods as by an
actual increase of money (or which is the same thing by an
increased economy in the use of it) in one country; or by
an increased quantity of goods or by a diminished amount
of money in another. In either of these cases a redundancy
of money is produced as effectually as if the mines had become
more productive. I do not deny that temporary
fluctuations do occur in the value of the precious metals;
on the contrary I maintain that those fluctuations never
cease; but I attribute them all to one cause, namely a redundancy
of the currency produced in one of the ways above
mentioned, and not to the demand for particular commodities.
These demands are in my opinion regulated by the
relative state of the currency; they are not causes but
effects. You appear to me not sufficiently to consider the
circumstances [which] induce one country to contract a
debt to another. [In] all the cases you bring forward you
always suppose the [deb]t already contracted, forgetting
that I uniformly contend that it is the relative state of the
currency which is the motive to the contract itself. The
corn, I say, will not be bought unless money be relatively
redundant; you answer me by supposing it already bought
and the question to be only concerning the payment. A
merchant will not contract a debt for corn to a foreign
country unless he is fully convinced that he shall obtain
for that corn more money than he contracts to pay for it,
and, if the commerce of the two countries were limited to
these transactions, it would as satisfactorily prove to me
that money was redundant in one country as that corn was
redundant in the other. It would prove too that nothing
but money was redundant. If indeed sugar were exported<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
by some other merchant, the debt for corn would be paid
without the exportation of money, and I should say that
sugar was the redundant commodity; and the exportation
of sugar, the more redundant commodity, by diminishing
the aggregate amount of commodities, would raise the
value of money, so that in a short time money would, if corn
continued to be imported and sugar exported, no longer be
redundant even as compared with corn. Your observation
is just, concerning the extra expenses attending the exportation
of bulky commodities; but in all these discussions
we must suppose these expenses to make part of the price
of the commodity; our comparison is made on the prices at
which the importer could afford to sell them, and those
prices necessarily include expenses of every sort. I do not
think that the knowledge of the computed exchange of
Jamaica would throw any light on the subject in dispute<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.
I will, however, endeavour to learn every particular concerning
it, and hope to be able on Saturday next to pay
you a visit in Hertfordshire, when we will further discuss
these seeming difficulties.</p>

<h3>VII.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="idt">I have been so much engaged since I had the
pleasure of receiving your letter that I have not had an
opportunity of answering it till this evening.</p>

<p>The information which you are desirous of obtaining
respecting the premium on bills in Jamaica from the year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
1808 to the present period, I will endeavour to procure,
but, as these transactions all take place in Jamaica, and as
the merchants here are frequently not acquainted with the
prices at which the bills remitted to them are negociated,
I am not sure that I shall be successful.</p>

<p>I very much regret that there is so little probability of
our finally agreeing on the subject which has lately engaged
our attention. The definition which you give of the word
'redundant,' as applied to the currency, is not satisfactory
to me. Though it should be allowed that the rise in the
price of one commodity, in the case of a scarcity of corn,
should be accompanied with a fall in the prices of all
others, why should a redundancy of currency be impossible
under such circumstances? The currency must, I apprehend,
be considered as a whole, and as such must be
compared with the whole of the commodities which it
circulates. If then it be in a greater proportion to commodities
after than before the scarce harvest, whilst no
such alteration has taken place in the proportions between
money and commodities abroad, it appears to me that no
expression can more correctly describe such a state of
things than a 'relative redundancy of currency.' Under
these circumstances not only money but every other commodity
would become comparatively cheap as compared
with corn, and would therefore be exported in return for
the corn which would be in demand in this country. By
relative redundance then I mean, relative cheapness, and
the exportation of the commodity I deem, in all ordinary
cases, the proof of such cheapness. Indeed, from one who
allows that the amount of money employed in any country
is regulated by its value, and might therefore be comparatively
redundant though it consisted only of a million, or
deficient though it amounted to a hundred millions, I should
not have expected any difference of opinion on the comparative
cheapness of money being the only satisfactory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
proof of its redundance. If however I thought that the
difference between us was as to the correct use of a word,
I should immediately yield the point in dispute, but I am
persuaded that we do not agree in the principle. You
are of opinion that a bad harvest will raise the price of
corn, but will lower in some degree the prices of other
commodities. Whether it would or would not do so is
not material; but, if your opinion is correct, then I say
there would be no exportation of money, because money
would not be the cheapest exportable commodity. If,
before the deficient harvest, money was at the same value
in any two countries, that is to say all their exportable
commodities without exception were at the same prices
in both, then, according to your view of the question, after
the scarcity the prices of all commodities would fall in
the country where such scarcity occurred. Whilst then
the prices were unequal in the two countries, commodities
only would be exported in exchange for corn, and there
would be no question between us, because we differ as to
the cause of the exportation of money. You have indeed
said that there may be a glut of commodities in the
foreign market. What! a glut of commodities with a
dearer price! impossible,&mdash;these two circumstances are incompatible.
If the price of any commodity had been &pound;20 in
both countries and in consequence of the bad harvest it
had been lowered to &pound;15 in one of them, there could not
be a glut of that commodity in the other country till it
had there also fallen to &pound;15. Not only must the price
of one commodity fall in the foreign market, but the
prices of all (because you suppose them all to have fallen
in England) before money could be exported in exchange
for corn, and then I would allow that money would be
exported, but even then it would be so only because it
was more cheap on the whole, as compared with commodities
in the exporting country, and this I contend is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the proof of its relative redundance. You maintain that
money is rendered cheap by a bad harvest as compared
with corn only, but with all other commodities it is
dearer than before,&mdash;and then, what appears to me very
inconsistent, you insist that this commodity thus rendered
scarce and dear will be exported, though, before it had
increased in value, it had no tendency to leave us, whilst
too there are commodities which have undergone an opposite
change, which from being dearer have become
cheaper, and which will nevertheless be obstinately retained
by us. This is a mode of reasoning which I cannot reconcile.</p>

<p>With respect to the other point, namely, that the
exchange accurately measures the depreciation of the
currency<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, I cannot but humbly retain that opinion notwithstanding
the high authorities against me. I do not
mean to contend that a convulsed state of the exchange,
such as would be caused by a subsidy granted to a foreign
power, would accurately measure the value of the currency,
because a demand for bills arising from such a cause
would not be in consequence of the natural commerce of
the country. Such a demand would therefore have the
effect of forcing the exports of commodities by means of
the bounty which the exchange would afford. After the
subsidy was paid the exchange would again accurately
express the value of the currency. The same effects
would follow, as in the case of a subsidy, from the foreign
expenditure of Government. These have a natural tendency
to create an unfavourable exchange, yet if the demand
for bills is regular it is surprising how this bounty on
exportation will be reduced by the competition amongst
the exporters of commodities. I am of opinion that in
the ordinary course of affairs, if, from any of the circumstances
so often mentioned, there should be a slight alteration
in the value of the currencies of any two countries, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
will speedily be communicated to the exchange; and, if
such a state of things should permanently continue, the
exchange has no tendency to correct itself. The fact
however appears to be that there is no degree of permanence
in the proportions between the currencies and the
commodities of nations,&mdash;they are subject to constant
fluctuations always approaching an absolute level but
never really finding it. I hope I have not wearied you
with the defence which I have endeavoured to make for
the opinions which I have imbibed. I assure you that I
am not obstinately attached to any system, but am ready
to relinquish any views I may have taken as soon as I
am satisfied that they are incorrect. I shall not fail
attentively to consider the chapters in Sir J. Steuart's
work which you have mentioned<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. I hope before the

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">I am exceedingly obliged to you for the trouble
which you have taken in looking over the papers which I
sent you, and for the remarks which you have made upon
them. Notwithstanding your flattering encouragement I
think I shall not have sufficient confidence again to address
the public;&mdash;the object which I had in view is completely
attained,&mdash;the public attention has been awakened, and the
discussion is now in the most able hands. I regret, however,
that you cannot bring yourself to subscribe to my
doctrine respecting the exchange being influenced by no
other causes but by the relation which the amount of currency
bears to the uses for which it is required in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
different nations of the earth. This may proceed from
your interpreting my proposition somewhat too rigidly.
I wish to prove that if nations truly understood their own
interest they would never export money from one country
to another but on account of comparative redundancy. I
assume indeed that nations in their commercial transactions
are so alive to their advantage and profit, particularly
in the present improved state of the division of employments
and abundance of capital, that in point of fact money
never does move but when it is advantageous both to the
country which sends and the country that receives that it
should do so. The first point to be considered is, what is
the interest of countries in the case supposed? The second
what is their practice? Now it is obvious that I need not
be greatly solicitous about this latter point; it is sufficient
for my purpose if I can clearly demonstrate that the interest
of the public is as I have stated it<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. It would be no answer
to me to say that men were ignorant of the best and
cheapest mode of conducting their business and paying
their debts, because that is a question of fact not of science,
and might be urged against almost every proposition in
Political Economy. It rests with you therefore to prove
that a case can exist where it may become the <i>interest</i> of a
nation to pay a debt by the transmission of money rather
than in any other mode, when money is not the cheapest
exportable commodity,&mdash;when money (taking into account
all expenses which may attend the exportation of different
commodities as well as money) will not purchase more
goods abroad than it will at home. You appear to me to
have repeatedly admitted that it is the relative prices of
commodities which regulates their exportation. Is it not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
then as certain that money will go to that country where
the major part of goods are cheap, as that goods will go to
any other country where the major part are dear? I say
the major part, because if the cheapness of one half of the
exportable commodities be balanced by the dearness of the
other half, in both countries, it is obvious that the commerce
of such countries will be confined to the exchange of goods
only. When you say that money will go abroad to pay a
debt or a subsidy, or to buy corn, although it be not superabundant,
but at the same time admit that [it] will speedily
return and be exchanged for goods, you ap[pear to me] to
concede all for which I contend, namely, that [it will] be
the <i>interest</i> of both countries, when money is not superabundant
in the one owing the debt, that the expense of
exporting the money should be spared, because it will be
followed by another useless expense,&mdash;sending it back
again.</p>

<p>If in any country there exists a dearness of importable
commodities and no corresponding cheapness of exportable
commodities, money in such country is above its natural
level and must infallibly be exported in payment of the
dear commodities,&mdash;but what does this state of things indicate
but an excess of currency, and it may surely be correctly
said that money is exported to restore the level not
to destroy it. I ought to apologise for again troubling you
with my opinions, but you have drawn me into it. I shall
be happy to renew our conversation on these disputed
points as soon as you can make it convenient to visit us in
London, and I trust it will not be long before Mrs. Malthus
and you will favour us with your company. On some
future day I shall have great pleasure in again visiting
you at Hertford.</p>

<p class="ralign1"><span class="smcap">New Grove, Mile End</span>, <i>22nd Dec., 1811</i>.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">I write to you, in the first place, to remind you that
Mrs. Ricardo and I fully depend on having the pleasure of
Mrs. Malthus' and your company at Mile-end in the next
month, when we hope that our endeavours to make your
visit comfortable will induce you to make a long stay with
us. In the second place, I am desirous of correcting some
of the errors in the papers which I left with you and which
I have been enabled to discover, as I have many others, by
the ingenious arguments with which you have opposed my
conclusions. In my endeavours to trace the effects of a
subsidy<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> in forcing the exportation of commodities, I stated,
if I recollect rightly, that it would occasion, first, a demand
for bills; secondly, an exportation of all those commodities
the prices of which already differed so much, in the two
countries, as to require only the trifling stimulus which the
first fall in the exchange would afford; thirdly, a real
alteration in the relative state of prices, viz. a rise in the
exporting and a fall in the importing country,&mdash;in a degree
too to counterbalance the advantage from the unfavourable
exchange; and lastly, a further fall of the exchange and a
consequent exportation of an additional quantity of goods
and then of money till the subsidy were paid. It appears,
then, that if the subsidy were small it would be wholly
paid by the exportation of commodities, as the fall in the
exchange would be sufficient to encourage <i>their</i> exportation,
but not sufficient to encourage the exportation of money.
If the exportation of money were in the same proportion
as the exportation of commodities, that is to say, supposing
the commodities of a country to be equal to 100, and its
money equal to two, then if not less than one fiftieth of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
exports in payment of the subsidy consisted of money,
prices would after such payment be the same as before in
both countries, and, although the exchange must have fallen
to that limit at which the exportation of money became
profitable, it would immediately have a tendency to recover,
and would shortly rise to par; but it is precisely because
less than this proportion of money will be exported that the
exchange will continue permanently unfavourable and will
have no tendency to rise, more than it will have to fall.</p>

<p>I believe you admit, that in the case of an augmentation
of 2 per cent. to our currency, although it were wholly
metallic, the prices of commodities would rise in this country
2 per cent. above their former level, and that such rise
being confined to this country alone it would check exportation
and encourage importation; the consequence of which
would be a demand for bills and a fall in the exchange.
This rise of prices and fall of the exchange, proceeding
from what you do not object to call a redundant currency,
would not be temporary but permanent, unless it were
corrected by a reduction of the amount of the currency
here, or by some change in the relative amount of the currencies
of other countries. That these would be the effects
of a direct augmentation of currency, I believe, you, with
very few qualifications, admit. Now, as a bad harvest or the
vote of a subsidy tend [<i>sic</i>] to produce the very same effects,
namely, a relative state of high prices at home, accompanied
by an unfavourable exchange, they admit only of the same
cure,&mdash;and, as in the case of an augmentation of currency
the exchange would have no tendency to rise, neither would
it in the case of a subsidy, the unfavourable exchange being
in both instances produced by a redundant currency, or in
more popular language by a relative state of prices which
renders the exportation of money most profitable<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
uniformly maintained that the money of the world is distributed
amongst the different countries according to their
commerce and payments, and that, if in any country it
should from any cause happen to exceed that proportion,
the excess would infallibly be exported to be divided
amongst the other countries. I have, however, always
supposed that my readers would understand me to mean
that this would be strictly the fact only if money could be
exported free from all expense. If the expenses of exporting
money to France be 3 per cent., to Vienna 5 per cent.,
to Russia 6 per cent., and to the East Indies 8 per cent., the
currency of England may exceed its natural level as compared
with those countries by 3, 5, 6, and 8 per cent. respectively,
and consequently the exchange may permanently
continue depressed in th[ose pr]oportions. If an excess of
currency once occurs, [the unfa]vourable exchange must
continue till some alterati[on in] the relative amount of
currency. The circumstances which [may] occasion such
an alteration are numerous, and are fully detailed in the
papers which I left with you. To the precise agreement
between the effects of an augmented currency and the
effects of a subsidy I most particularly request your attention,
as on such agreement depends the whole success of
the argument which I am advancing in favour of my
opinion that an unfavourable exchange has no tendency
to correct itself. It may be urged that the relative state of
high prices at home occasioned by an augmentation of currency
is the natural effect of such a cause, but that this is
not the case in a subsidy; that the exportation of commodities
in payment of a subsidy is forced, and that it will
produce a glut in the foreign market, but that after the
subsidy is paid and the necessity for exportation shall
cease prices will rise in the foreign market to their former
rate. This however will not be true. Commodities may
rise in a trifling degree abroad, but cannot regain their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
former rate unless the exchange should also rise to par, but
this it can never do whilst the demand for bills do[es] not
exceed the supply. Now, as the prices of foreign commodities
in the home market, which could not have been
supplied in the usual abundance during the operation of the
subsidy when we had a large balance to pay, would fall,
and would be in greater demand from the moment that our
commodities would be received in exchange, the exportation
of our goods would be balanced by the importation of
foreign goods, and the sellers of bills would neither exceed
nor fall short of the purchasers. These are the substance of
the amendments which I wish to make to my paper, which
is now so faulty that I shall be glad to have it returned to
me. Have the goodness to bring it with you when you
come to town.</p>

<p class="idt">I intend leaving town this evening for Ramsgate,
where I think I shall stay about a fortnight, so that I
cannot accept your kind invitation for Saturday next;
but I hope it will not be long before I bend my steps
towards your hospitable roof. If on Saturday the 19th

I shall be obliged to quit you on the Monday morning.
I hope I need not say that I shall be exceedingly sorry

am obliged to you for the interest you take in the price

Mr. Goldsmid<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> informs me that at the period of the improvement

were no importations, as far as he knows, of gold from

exchange which may not be corrected by a
diminution in the amount of the currency, and I consider
this to afford a proof that the currency must be redundant

it is always accompanied, though not always caused, by an
excess of currency. With best respects to Mrs. Malthus,</p>

Thornton's answer. He is engaged on Wednesday and
Thursday, and has fixed on Monday for our meeting, but
he wishes us to meet at his house as there is to be a
debate in the House of Lords on the Bullion question,
and he is not sure that his presence may not be necessary
in the Commons. I will settle this point with him, and if
you do not hear from me I shall expect you at my house
on Monday, if you do not agree to come on Saturday
evening.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Thomas Tooke, in his 'History of Prices and of the State
of the Circulation from 1839 to 1847' (publ. 1848)<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>, refers to this
dispute between Ricardo and Malthus, on the relation of the currency
to the balance of trade, and quotes long extracts from the
article of Malthus in the Edinburgh Review, where (as in this
correspondence<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>) Malthus maintains that the precious metals are
continually used in payments made by one country to another even if,
till that moment, the currencies of both have been at their usual
level. The view of Ricardo is that nothing but the state of the
currency can influence the foreign exchanges. As late as 1840
statesmen clung to the idea that the Directors of the Bank of
England could only operate on the exchanges by increasing or
diminishing the circulation<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. Tooke (followed later by Newmarch,
hardly a less authority) sides with Malthus, and thinks that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Ricardo's reply to him, in the Appendix to the Tract on Bullion,
is 'little more than a repetition in varied forms of expression,
according to the phraseology peculiar to the theory in question,
of the axiom that gold will not be exported unless it is cheaper
than another commodity, assuming consequently the fact to have
been that all commodities were at that time dearer in this country
than they were abroad, and relatively to gold;'&mdash;whereas it
appears<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> that between 1809 and 1811 the bulk of commodities
were at a far higher price (measured in gold) on the Continent
than in England; the 'continental system' had forced vast stores
of goods to lie unsaleable in England for want of physical ability,
on the part of the merchants of them, to land them on the Continent,
though they did their best to smuggle them by way of
Heligoland or Turkey into Germany and the door of Portugal
was ajar. Coffee was unsaleable in England at 6<i>d.</i> the pound, and
at the same time it was fetching 4<i>s.</i> or 5<i>s.</i> on the Continent.
Napoleon used to look at the English price current, and, if he
found gold dear and coffee cheap in England, he was satisfied that
his Berlin and Milan decrees were well carried out, while the
English saw only another proof that the Bank was extending its
issues overmuch. Tooke and Malthus agreed that the difference
between the market price and the mint price of gold bullion was
the full measure of the depreciation of the currency; but the
'ultra-bullionists' would not stop there. Tooke, like Ricardo on
another occasion (see Letter XLII), had to 'write a book to convince'
them, namely his 'Thoughts and Details on the High and
Low Prices of the last Thirty years,' (1823).</p></div>

<p class="idt">I have been amusing myself for one or two evenings
in calculating the exchanges, price of gold, etc., at Amsterdam,

reason to believe that my calculations are correct,&mdash;though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
I am somewhat puzzled at the profit which there appears
to be on the importation of gold from Amsterdam, if the
prices there be quoted correct [<i>sic</i>]. If the difference were
the other way, we might ascribe it to the money of
Holland not being so good as it ought to be by the mint
regulations; but in the present instance for guilders, as
good as they are coined, gold can be bought 9&frac12; per cent.
cheaper than in London. I am told that gold which
cannot be exported has sunk considerably in price although
gold that may be exported keeps its price. I fully expect
that foreign gold will be lower.</p>

<p>Against 16 per cent. in column 1 the par of exchange in
column 8 is 39&middot;64, and against &pound;5 10<i>s.</i> the price of gold in
London in column 9 the multiplier &middot;708 stands in column 10.
39&middot;64 multiplied by &middot;708 gives 28&middot;06 as the par for bank
notes; therefore, when the exchange is at 31, it is unfavourable
to Holland, and gold may be exported from
thence with a profit of 10&frac12; per cent. nearly. Or thus:
an oz. of standard gold, when the marc could be bought
at 16 per cent. premium at Amsterdam, would cost 154&middot;3
Flemish shillings banco, when the agio was 3 per cent.,
which reduced into English money at 31 [Flemish] shillings
per &pound; sterling will give &pound;4 19<i>s.</i> 6&frac34;<i>d.</i> But it will sell in
London for &pound;5 10<i>s.</i> which is a profit of 10&frac12; per cent.
nearly.</p>

<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>1 Jan., 1814</i>.</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">Having finished a table for the Hamburgh exchanges,
similar to that which I have already sent you
for Holland, I thought you might like to have a copy of
it<a name="FNanchor_59_61" id="FNanchor_59_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_61" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. In this as well as in the other the result is not quite
satisfactory; for example, at the present time I believe the
exchange with Hamburgh is quoted 28<i>s.</i> and the price of
dollars 6<i>s.</i> 11&frac12;<i>d.</i> By the table it appears that with [such]
a price of dollars the exchange at par would be 25<i>s.</i>; consequently
it is now unfavourable to Hamburgh 12 per cent.,
which appears to me to be excessively high. In fact,
under the present circumstances, there can be no intercourse
with Hamburgh, and the quotation must be only nominal.
Mrs. Ricardo and I leave London to-morrow early for
Bradford; from thence we intend going to Gatcomb<a name="FNanchor_60_62" id="FNanchor_60_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_62" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>, and
expect to be in town again on Thursday. I hope we shall
soon see you. With best wishes to Mrs. Malthus,</p>

<p class="idt">... I cannot partake of your doubts respecting
the effects of restrictions on the importation of corn in
tending to lower the rate of interest. The rise of the price
or rather the value of corn without any augmentation of
capital must necessarily diminish the demand for other
things even if the prices of those commodities did not rise
with the price of corn, which they would (tho' slowly) certainly
do. With the same capital there would be less production
and less demand. Demand has no other limits but
the want of power of paying for the commodities demanded.
Everything which tends to diminish production tends to
diminish this power. The rate of profits and of interest must
depend on the proportion of production to the consumption
necessary to such production,&mdash;this again essentially depends
upon the cheapness of provisions, which is after all,
whatever intervals we may be willing to allow, the great
regulator of the wages of labour. Nothing can tend more
effectually to diminish the demand abroad for our manufactures
than to refuse to import corn and other commodities
which we [had] usually taken in exchange for
such manufactures. If we rigorously refused to import
any [foreign] commodity whatever, I firmly believe that
we should soon cease to export any commodity, even if we
made gold an exception to the general rule. Our money
would stand at a higher level than in other countries, but
there are limits beyond which it could not go. All trade
is at last a trade of barter, and no nation will long buy
unless it can also sell,&mdash;nor will it long sell if it will not
also buy. If by adopting such policy [<i>sic</i>] a country were to
enhance the value of the raw materials which it consumed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of which corn is the principal, it would thereby lower the
rate of interest. If otherwise, it might be deprived of
many luxuries and many comforts, or might enjoy them in
less abundance, but the rate of interest would not fall.
This is a repetition, you will say, of the old story, and I
might have spared you the trouble of reading at 200 miles
distance what I had so often stated to you as my opinion
before; but you have set me off, and must now abide the
consequences. I never was more convinced of any proposition
in Political Economy than that restrictions on importation
of corn in an importing country have a tendency to
lower profits. Remember me kindly to Mrs. Malthus.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">I am writing to you from Gatcomb, where I arrived
with S&mdash;&mdash; as my companion yesterday afternoon. To
enable me to quit London at the time I did I was obliged
to bestow an unusual degree of attention to business of all
sorts, and, though I had written a letter to you in answer
to your last before I left Brook Street, I was so dissatisfied
with it that I could not resolve to send it. I shall, I fear,
succeed no better now, but you shall have it whatever it
may be, as, if I defer writing any longer, you may have
quitted Bangor before my letter arrives there<a name="FNanchor_61_63" id="FNanchor_61_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_63" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. It appears
to me that you have changed the proposition on which we
first appeared to differ. The proposition advanced by you,
if I recollect right, was that restrictions on the importation
of corn would not lower the rate of profits and interest,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
but now you add&mdash;or rather your argument leads to that
conclusion,&mdash;'if the consequence of such restriction be a
great reduction of capital.' So amended I should not
object to the proposition,&mdash;but I think it material that
causes should be kept distinct, and their due effects
ascribed to each. Restrictions on the trade of corn, if
capital suffers no diminution, will occasion a fall in the
rate of profits and interest. A reduction of capital independently
of restrictions on importation of corn will have
a tendency to raise profits and interest,&mdash;but there is no
necessary connection between these two operating causes,
as they may at the same time be acting together or
entirely in opposite directions. Effective demand, it appears
to me, cannot augment or long continue stationary
with a diminishing capital; and your question why if this
were true profits rise at the commencement of a war?
does not, I think, bear any connection with the argument,
because profits will augment under a diminution of capital
and produce, if demand though diminished does not
diminish so rapidly as capital and produce. For the opposite
reason profits will diminish when capital and produce
increase. This is totally independent of the rate of
production, and often, I think, may counteract the effects
which usually follow, and in the long run will almost
always follow, from increasing or diminishing capital. You
say that 'the proportion of production to the consumption
necessary to such production seems to be determined by
the quantity of accumulated capital compared with the
demand for the products of capital, and not by the mere
difficulty and expense of procuring corn.' It appears to
me that the difficulty and expense<a name="FNanchor_62_64" id="FNanchor_62_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_64" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> of procuring corn will
necessarily regulate the demand for the products of capital,
for the demand must essentially depend on the price at
which they can be afforded, and the prices of all com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>modities
must increase if the price of corn be increased.
The capitalist 'who may find it necessary to employ a
hundred days' labour instead of fifty in order to produce a
certain quantity of corn' cannot retain the same share for
himself unless the labourers who are employed for a hundred
days will be satisfied with the same quantity of corn
for their subsistence that the labourers employed for fifty
had before. If you suppose the price of corn doubled, the
capital to be employed, estimated in money, will probably
be also nearly doubled,&mdash;or at any rate will be greatly
augmented; and, if his monied income is to arise from the
sale of the corn which remains to him after defraying the
charges of production, how is it possible to conceive that
the rate of his profits will not be diminished? I hope you
continue to enjoy yourself amidst the wild scenery with
which you are encompassed.&mdash;The weather here is delightful,
and I am as happy as I can be, separated from the
whole family (except S&mdash;&mdash;) and surrounded by upholsterers,
carpenters, etc....</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">I received your letter last Sunday, and in the
evening of that day Mrs. Ricardo and the rest of my
family arrived here. I have been showing them all the
beauties of this place, and my time has been pretty well
engrossed by them these three last days.... The fall in
Omnium is I believe to be attributed to our continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
expenses, and the expectation of another loan before the
payments on the present are completed. The present
state of the Exchanges seem[s] to indicate a real fall in
the value of foreign currencies; it cannot be attributed
to any change of taste for particular commodities, or any
other caprice. I expected that Peace would lower the
value of foreign currency, but I confess not in the degree
which has taken place. It leaves the question between us
undecided&mdash;namely, whether the exchange is not operated
upon solely by the relative preponderance of currency.
Peace has rendered the currency of the continent much
more efficacious to the business to be done.</p>

<p>With regard to our present question, we differ as to
effects which must <i>necessarily</i> follow from restrictions on
the importation of foreign corn. I do not think that a
diminution of capital is a <i>necessary</i>, but a probable effect.
We agree as to the consequences which will attend a
diminution of capital, but I should say that a real diminution
of capital will diminish the work to be done, and
consequently will affect the wages of labour, and the
demand for food. In the case supposed, restrictions on
importation of corn, encouragement is given to the further
cultivation of our own land,&mdash;but <i>if</i> accompanied by a
diminution of capital a discouragement is also given to
the cultivation of the land, and whether profits rise or fall
must in my opinion depend upon the degree of these
contra-operating causes. It is true that the woollen or
cotton manufacturer will not be able to work up the same
quantity of goods with the same capital if he is obliged to
pay more for the labour which he employs, but his profits
will depend on the price at which his goods when manufactured
will sell. If every person is determined to live
on his revenue or income, without infringing on his
capital, the rise of his goods will not be in the same proportion
as the rise of labour, and consequently his per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>centage
of profit will be diminished if he values his capital,
which he must do, in money at the increased value to
which all goods would rise in consequence of the rise
of the wages of labour. In such case I should say that
the effective demand had diminished, because the same
quantity of commodities could not be annually consumed.
If the same quantity of commodities continued to be consumed,
then it must be evident that it would be at the
expense of capital. In such case capital would diminish
faster than demand, which would tend to keep up
profits. But how long will [people] continue to indulge
in luxuries at the expense of a continual diminution of
capital? It is the road to ruin, and, though frequently
persisted in by a few individuals, it is not often found to
be the folly of nations. On the contrary, if any causes
interrupt the progress of nations, if restrictions on their
trade, or expensive wars, tend to diminish their capital,
at such times more economy is practised, and, as Adam
Smith has observed, the profusion of governments is
counteracted by the frugality of individuals. If so, I
cannot be incorrect in saying that, though for a short
period capital and produce may diminish faster than demand,&mdash;yet
in the long run effective demand cannot
augment or continue stationary with a diminishing capital.
You say, what I did not before understand you to admit,
'that the whole amount of demand will from advanced
prices diminish of course, but the proportion of demand to
supply, which is always the main point in question, as
determining prices and profits, may continue to increase,
<i>as it does in all countries the capital of which is retrograde</i>;'
but I do not agree even to this explanation, and it appears
to me to be at variance with an opinion which I have
often heard you express, viz. The temptation to save from
revenue to augment capital is always in proportion to the
rate of profits, and, if from accumulation of capital profits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and interest should fall very low indeed, at that point
accumulation would nearly stop, because it would be almost
without an object. In this opinion I most cordially agree,
and I cannot help thinking that it is at variance with the
above sentence which I have quoted from your letter. I
maintain, as I think you have done, that consumption as
compared with production is always greatest where capital
is most accumulated. Diminish the capital of England
one half, and you undoubtedly augment profits, but it will
not be in consequence of a greater proportion of demand but
of a greater proportion of production; demand as compared
with production could hardly fail to diminish. Individuals
do not estimate their profits by the material production,
but nations invariably do. If we had precisely the same
amount of commodities of all descriptions in the year 1815
that we now have in 1814, as a nation we should be no
richer; but, if money had sunk in value, they would be
represented by a greater quantity of money, and individuals
would be apt to <i>think</i> themselves richer. I shall
be in town either next week or the week after. I wish
you would return here with me. We would discuss these
important points in our shady groves. With kind regards
to Mrs. Malthus,</p>

<p class="idt">I left London on the 19th, the day before your letter
arrived there, having dispatched all my business in four
days. The appearance of the Omnium was not sufficiently
inviting to induce me to protract my stay longer than was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
absolutely necessary. David<a name="FNanchor_63_65" id="FNanchor_63_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_65" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>, who is come to pass his holidays
with us, brought me your letter. I regret that I shall
not see you for some time, as you cannot come here, and I
shall not have it in my power at present to visit Hail[e]ybury.
I expected to have a great deal of leisure time in
the country, but as yet I have not had any. Walking and
riding with my family, and friends who have visited us,
have entirely occupied me; besides which, the only room
in my house which is not finished is the library, owing
to the tedious time which they have taken to fix my
bookcases.</p>

<p>I think if we could talk together we should not <i>very</i>
much differ on the question which has lately engaged us;
our principal difference is about the permanence of the
effects. It will often happen that the scarcity of a commodity
or the increasing demand for it will for a time
increase profits; but it is not therefore correct to say that,
where profits are high, they are so because the demand
for produce is great compared with supply. There are
many other causes which will occasion profits to be permanently
high. There may be two countries, in one of
which, from bad government and the consequent insecurity
of property, or from the little disposition to saving in the
people, profits may be permanently high and interest at
12 per cent., whilst in the other, where these causes do not
operate, profits may be permanently low and interest at
5 per cent. It would surely be incorrect to say that the
cause of the high profits was the greater proportion of
demand for produce, when in both countries the supply
would be or might be precisely equal to the demand and
no more. In America profits are higher than in England,
and yet I can have no doubt that the proportion of supply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
to demand is greater in the former country. I think it
must necessarily be so in all countries which are most
rapidly increasing in riches, for from whence do riches
come but from production preponderating over consumption?
Profits are sometimes high when corn is scarce and
dear; but this arises from the stimulus which the high
prices give to industry. If the population could immediately
accommodate itself to the scanty supply, no such
effects would follow; and in fact they only continue till
time has gradually equalised them.</p>

<p>I sometimes suspect that we do not attach the same
meaning to the word 'demand.' If corn rises in price, [you]
perhaps attribute it to a greater demand. I should [attribute
it to] a greater competition. The demand cannot,
I think, be said to increase if the quantity consumed be
diminished, although much more money may be required
to purchase the smaller than the larger quantity. If it
were to be asked what the demand was for port-wine
in England in the years 1813 and 1814, and it were to be
answered that in the first year she had imported 5000 pipes,
and in the next 4500, should we not all agree that the
demand was greater in 1813? Yet it might be true that
double the quantity of money was paid for the 4500 pipes.</p>

<p>Have you read the report of the Lord[s'] Committee on the
Corn question? It discloses some important facts; but how
ignorant the persons giving evidence appear to be of the
subject as a matter of science! The Editor's remarks too
are very unworthy of his paper.</p>

thought that before any certain conclusions could be reached the
inquiry must go on further. There is a copiously annotated copy
of them in the 'Place' Collection in the British Museum.</p></div>

<p class="idt">... I agree with you that, when capital is scanty
compared with the means of employing it, from whatever
cause arising, profits will be high. Whether temporarily or
permanently must of course depend upon whether the cause
be temporary or permanent. It is, however, very important
to ascertain what the causes are which make capital scanty
compared with the means of employing it, and how far,
when ascertained, they may be considered temporary or
permanent.</p>

<p>It is in this inquiry that I am led to believe that the
state of the cultivation of the land is almost the only great
permanent cause. There are other circumstances which are
attended with temporary effects of more or less duration
and frequently operate partially on particular trades. The
state of production from the land, compared with the means
necessary to make it produce, operates on all, and is alone
lasting in its effects.</p>

<p>We agree too that effectual demand consists of two
elements, the <i>power</i> and the <i>will</i> to purchase; but I think
the will is very seldom wanting where the power exists, for
the desire of accumulation will occasion demand just as
effectually as a desire to consume; it will only change the
objects on which the demand will exercise itself. If you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
think that, with an increase of capital, men will become
indifferent both to consumption and accumulation, then
you are correct in opposing Mr. Mill's idea<a name="FNanchor_64_66" id="FNanchor_64_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_66" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>, that in reference
to a nation supply can never exceed demand; but does
not an increase of capital beget an increased inclination for
luxuries of all descriptions? and, though it appears natural
that the desire of accumulation should decrease with an
increase of capital and diminished profits, it appears equally
probable that consumption will increase in the same ratio.
Exchanges will be as active as ever; the objects only will
be altered. If demand <i>appears</i> more active where capital
is scarce, it is only because the <i>power</i> to purchase is comparatively
greater. Wherever capital is scanty, the necessaries
of life are cheap, if the country is commonly fertile;
and, as capital and population increase, the necessaries of
life rise in price, and thus is the power of purchasing, though
really greater, comparatively less. In a country with little
comparative capital, the value of the yearly produce may
very rapidly increase; and, if it be said to be in consequence
of the greatness of demand, I should contend that in
such country the demand would not be limited in the same
degree by a want of power as in a country abounding in
capital, and merely because provisions would not rise in the
same proportion in the two countries. If half as much corn
[again] as usual were produced next year, a great part of it
would undoubtedly be wasted; and the same might be said
of any commodities which we might be ingenious enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
to name: but the real question is this&mdash;If money should
retain the same value next year, would any man (if he had
it) want the will to spend half as much again as he now
does? and, if he did want the will, would he feel no inclination
to add the increase of his revenue to his capital and
employ it as such? In short, I consider the wants and
tastes of mankind as unlimited. We all wish to add to our
enjoyments or to our power. Consumption adds to our
enjoyments, accumulation to our power, and they equally
promote demand.</p>

give us great pleasure if you would give us the whole of

me express myself in a more than usually bungling manner.
She unites with me in kind regards to Mrs. Malthus.</p>

<span class="smcap">Gatcomb Park</span>, <i>23rd Oct., 1814</i>.</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">On the day that you were writing your last letter
to me, I was travelling to London with Mrs. Ricardo,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
where my business detained me a little more than a week.
On my return your letter was delivered to me. I am sorry
that you cannot make it convenient to pay us a visit at
Christmas. I shall however depend on your not allowing
any common occurrence to prevent you and Mrs. Malthus
from favouring<a name="FNanchor_67_69" id="FNanchor_67_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_69" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> us with your company during your next
summer vacation. I hope you will not repent having set me
the example of using a larger sized paper. If you are tired
with my long letter, you only will be to blame for it.</p>

<p>It does not appear to me that we very materially differ
in our ideas of the effects of the facility or difficulty of
procuring food on the profits of stock. You say that I
'seem to think that the state of production from the land
compared with the means necessary to make it produce
is almost the sole cause which regulates the profit of stock
and the means of advantageously employing capital.' This
is a correct statement of my opinion, and not, as you have
said in another part of your letter and which essentially
differs from it, 'that it is the <i>quantity</i> of produce compared
with the expense of production that determines profits.'
You, instead of allowing the facility of obtaining food to
be almost the sole cause of high profits, think it may be
safely said to be the main cause, and also a difficulty of
acquiring food the main cause of low profits. There appears
to me to be very little difference in these statements.
You infer that my doctrine is not correct because improvements
may take place in agriculture or manufactures,
because new leases may not be granted precisely at the
time of the rise in the price of raw produce, and because
the price of labour may not rise without delay in the
same proportion. But improvements in agriculture or in
machinery which shall facilitate or augment production
will according to my proposition increase profits because
'it will augment production compared with the means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
necessary to that production.' The same may be said of
the wages of labour not rising in the same proportion as
the price of produce. As for old leases affecting the
question, you will observe that in calculating the profits
made by agriculture we must estimate leases at the value
which they bear at the time of the calculation and not at
the value agreed upon at an antecedent period. If the
question were concerning the profits of a manufactory or
distillery for example, we should calculate such profits
according to the then value of barley, although a few
individual distillers might have been so fortunate as to
purchase their barley when it was 25 per cent cheaper.
These points then are expressly allowed for in my proposition,
and are by no means at variance with it. You
add to your statement [']that in the interval between the
two extremes (of high profits and low profits caused by
facility or difficulty of procuring food) considerable variations
may take place, and that practically no country
was ever in such a state as not to admit of increase of
profits on the land for a period of some duration, from the
advanced price of raw produce.' I agree that variations
will take place because the means of obtaining produce
are not always equally expensive; and, if they should be,
the produce itself may become more valuable, and in
either case profits will vary. But even during these
temporary variations the great cause, namely the accumulation
of capital, may be paving the way for permanently
diminished profits. It appears to me important to ascertain
what the causes are which may occasion a rise in the
price of raw produce, because the effects of a rise, on
profits, may be diametrically opposite. A rise in the price
of raw produce may be occasioned by a gradual accumulation
of capital, which by creating new demands for labour
may give a stimulus to population and consequently promote
the cultivation or improvement of inferior lands;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
but this will not cause profits to rise but to fall, because
not only will the rate of wages rise, but more labourers
will be employed without affording a proportional return
of raw produce. The whole value of the wages paid will
be greater compared with the whole value of the raw
produce obtained. A rise of raw produce may proceed
from one or more bad seasons, which will undoubtedly
increase profits because the price of produce would rise
considerably more than in the proportion of the deficient
quantity, and would therefore be much ahead of the price
[<i>sic</i>] of production. An advanced price of raw produce
may also proceed from a fall in the value of currency,
which would raise the price of produce, for a time, more
than it would wages, and would therefore raise profits.
Both these you will allow are temporary causes, no way
affecting the principle itself but merely disturbing it in
its progress. Restrictions on importation of raw produce
may cause a rise in its price which will be permanent
or temporary according as the bad policy which dictated
the restrictive law may be permanent or temporary. In
the first instance profits will be raised; but they will
ultimately fall below their former level. From what I
have said it will appear that I am of opinion that a
permanent rise in the rate of profits on land is never
preceded by a rise but by a fall in the price of raw
produce; and, though profits may be raised by a rise of
the price of produce, they will generally ultimately settle
at a rate lower than that from which they started. The
converse of this, as it regards low prices of produce, I hold
to be equally true. I should be glad to have your sentiments
on this point. There may be other causes of high
price, which do not at present occur to me.</p>

<p>I allow that no country ever was or can be in such a
situation as not to admit of increase of profits on the land,
because there is no country which is not liable to lose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
or waste part of its capital; there is no country which is not
liable to bad seasons, to depreciated currency, to a real fall
in the value of the precious metals, and to other accidents
which will, some permanently and some temporarily, raise
profits. You observe that in rich countries profits are often
much higher, and in poor countries much lower than according
to my theory, to which I reply that profits are very
much reduced in the poor country by enormous wages; the
wages themselves may be considered as part of the profits
of stock, and are frequently the foundation of new capital.
In rich countries wages are low, too low for the comforts
of the labourers; too large a portion of the gross produce
is retained by the owner of stock and is reckoned as profit.</p>

<p>I am not aware that I have underrated the effect of the
wants and tastes of mankind on profits; they frequently
occasion large profits on particular commodities for short
periods, but they do not, I think, often operate on general
profits, because they do not often influence the growth of
raw produce. Adam Smith, in Book V, ch. i, p. 134<a name="FNanchor_68_70" id="FNanchor_68_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_70" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>, concisely
expresses what appears to me correct, of the effects
of demand on the price of commodities. I go much further
than you in ascribing effects to the wants and tastes of
mankind; I believe them to be unlimited. Give men but
the means of purchasing, and their wants are insatiable.
Mr. Mill's theory is built on this assumption. It does not
attempt to say what the proportions will be to one another
of the commodities which will be produced in consequence
of the accumulation of capital, but presumes that those
commodities only will be produced which will be suited
to the wants and tastes of mankind, because none other
will be demanded.</p>

<p>The very term 'accumulation of capital' supposes a power
somewhere to employ more labour; it supposes the total<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
income of the society to be increased, and therefore to
create a demand for more food and more commodities.
You ask 'whether we can furnish to persons of the same
incomes a great additional quantity of commodities without
lowering the price so much compared with the price
of production as to destroy the effective demand for such
a supply, and consequently to check its continuance to
the same extent.' We answer this is not our case; we are
speaking of larger incomes, not of the same incomes; and
instead of anticipating a fall in the price of commodities
we should expect a rise, because the fall of profits which
generally follows accumulation is in consequence of the
increase in the price of production, compared with the
price of produce, although they would both undoubtedly
rise. You appear to think, indeed you say, 'that you
know no other cause for the fall of profits which generally
takes place from accumulation than that the price of
produce falls compared with the expense of production,
or in other words, that the <i>effective</i> demand is diminished;'
and by what follows you seem to infer that commodities
will not only be relatively lower but really lower; and
this is in fact the foundation of our difference with regard
to the theory of Mr. Mill.</p>

<p>You will by this time feel that you have enough if not
too much.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The passage of the Wealth of Nations is as follows:&mdash;'The
East India Company represented in very strong terms what
had been at this time [1730] the miserable effects, as they thought
them, of this competition [between themselves and the Old East
India Company and private traders]. In India, they said, it
raised the price of goods so high that they were not worth buying;
and in England, by overstocking the market, it sunk their price
so low that no profit could be made by them.  That by a more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
plentiful supply, to the great advantage and conveniency of the
public, it must have reduced very much the price of India goods
in the English market cannot well be doubted; but that it should
have raised very much their price in the Indian market seems
not very probable, as all the extraordinary demand which that
competition could occasion must have been but as a drop of water
in the immense ocean of Indian commerce. The increase of demand,
besides, though in the beginning it may sometimes raise the
price of goods, never fails to lower it in the long run. It encourages
production, and thereby increases the competition of the
producers, who, in order to undersell one another, have recourse to
new divisions of labour and new improvements of art, which might
never otherwise have been thought of. The miserable effects of
which the company complained were the cheapness of consumption
and the encouragement given to production: precisely the two
effects which it is the great business of political economy to promote.'</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Gatcomb Park</span>, <i>18 Dec., 1814</i>.</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">Since I received your last letter I have been unexpectedly
called from home, besides having had friends
staying with me, which have prevented me from writing
sooner. I have been twice to Bath and once to Cheltenham,
and have also been as far as Devonshire, to the old
Abbey which Mr. Bentham<a name="FNanchor_69_71" id="FNanchor_69_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_71" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> at present inhabits. I accompanied
M. Say, the author of &Eacute;conomie Politique, on
a visit to him and Mr. Mill<a name="FNanchor_70_72" id="FNanchor_70_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_72" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>;&mdash;and, had it not been for
the incessant rain, we should have had a very pleasant
excursion. M. Say came to me here from London at the
request of Mr. Mill, who wished us to be acquainted with
each other. He intends seeing you before he quits this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
country. He does not appear to me to be ready in conversation
on the subject on which he has very ably written,&mdash;and
indeed in his book there are many points which I
think are very far from being satisfactorily established,&mdash;yet
he is an unaffected agreeable man, and I found him an
instructive companion.</p>

<p>We intend to be in London in the middle of January,
and have little doubt that we shall return here quite time
enough to receive a visit from Mrs. Malthus and you next
summer vacation, so I trust you will not project an excursion
to any other quarter.</p>

<p>I perceive that we are not nearly agreed on the subject
which we have been lately discussing. I have been endeavouring
to get you to admit that the profits on stock
employed in manufactures and commerce are seldom permanently
lowered or raised by any other cause than by
the cheapness or dearness of necessaries, or of those objects
on which the wages of labour are expended. Accumulation
of capital has a tendency to lower profits. Why?
because every accumulation is attended with increased
difficulty in obtaining food, unless it is accompanied with
improvements in agriculture; in which case it has no
tendency to diminish profits. If there were no increased
difficulty, profits would never fall, because there are no
other limits to the profitable production of manufactures
but the rise of wages. If with every accumulation of
capital we could tack a piece of fresh fertile land to our
Island, profits would never fall. I admit at the same time
that commerce, or machinery, may produce an abundance
and cheapness of commodities, and if they affect the prices
of those commodities on which the wages of labour are
expended they will so far raise profits:&mdash;but then it will
be true that less capital will be employed on the land, for
the wages paid for labour form a part of that capital. A
diminution of the proportion of produce, in consequence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the accumulation of capital, does not fall wholly on the
owner of stock, but is shared with him by the labourers.
The whole amount of wages paid will be greater, but the
portion paid to each man will in all probability be somewhat
diminished.</p>

<p>I do not recollect ever having allowed that an extension
of foreign commerce will take capital from the land, unless
we were an exporting country as far as regards corn, in
which case my proposition would be true, namely that the
rate of profits can never permanently rise unless capital be
withdrawn from the land. I am not sanguine about the
principle, if true, being of any use; but that is another
consideration;&mdash;its utility has nothing to do with its truth,
and it is the latter only which I am at present anxious to
establish. I cannot agree with you when you say that
'without supposing capital to be taken from the land the
throwing of new objects of desire into the market will
increase the value of the whole mass of commodities in the
country, estimated either in money, or in corn and labour,'&mdash;and
it is because I think that there will not be a greater
value of commodities to be exchanged for the raw produce,
or for money, that I conclude no increased profits will anywhere
be made. If the mass of commodities be increased
we diminish their exchangeable value as compared with
those things whose quantity is not augmented. If we
double the quantity, or rather double the facility of
making stockings, we diminish their value one half, as
compared with <i>all</i> other commodities. If we do the same
with regard to hats and shoes, we restore the accustomed
relations between stockings, hats, and shoes, but not with
respect to other things. It is here, I think, that our
difference rests, and I hope soon to hear all that you have
to advance in favour of your view of the question.</p>

<p>M. Say, in the new edition of his book, p. 99, vol. i,
supports, I think, the very [same] doctrine that demand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
is regulated by production. Demand [is] always an exchange
of one commodity for another. The shoemaker
when he exchanges his shoes for bread has an effective
demand for bread, as well as the baker has an effective
demand for shoes,&mdash;and, although it is clear that the shoemaker's
demand for bread must be limited by his wants,
yet whilst he has shoes to offer in exchange he will have
an effective demand for other things,&mdash;and if his shoes are
not in demand it shows that he has not been governed by
the just principles of trade, and that he has not used his
capital and his labour in the manufacture of the commodity
required by the society,&mdash;more caution will enable him to
correct his error in his future production. Accumulation
necessarily increases production and as necessarily increases
consumption. Accumulation of <i>produce</i>, if properly selected,
<i>may</i> always be accumulation of <i>capital</i>, and it cannot fail to
be worth more than it cost, estimated in corn or labour,&mdash;and
this I think would be true although all our soldiers,
sailors, and menial servants were employed in productive
labour. It appears to me that the consideration of money
value may be the foundation of our difference on this
point.</p>

<p>I must leave room for a request which I hope you will
not refuse. I dined a little while ago at Mr. Smith's, whom
I first met at your house. Mrs. Smith told me that she
had a collection of the handwriting of a great number of
men who had distinguished themselves by their writings,
and she wished that I would give her a letter of yours
to add to her collection. Knowing that I had many which
would not discredit you, I assented; but after I came home
I thought I had no right to do it without your consent&mdash;which
I hope you will not refuse. I should be sorry to
disappoint her, and should really cut a poor figure in
making my apologies if I did; yet, as my opinion, that
I should not do it without your consent, is confirmed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Mrs. Ricardo, I must falter out my excuses if you are
inexorable. With kind regards to Mrs. Malthus,</p>


<p class="ralign">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">I am, ever yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">David Ricardo</span>.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Of Ricardo, Bentham used to say: 'I was the spiritual
father of Mill, and Mill was the spiritual father of Ricardo; so
that Ricardo was my spiritual grandson. I was often <i>t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te</i>
with Ricardo. He would borrow a sixpenny book instead of
buying it. There was an <i>&eacute;panchement</i> between us. We used to
walk together in Hyde Park, and he reported to me what passed
in the House of Commons. He had several times intended to
quote the 'Fragment'; but his courage failed him as he told me.
In Ricardo's book on rent there is a want of logic. I wanted him
to correct it on these principles; but he was not conscious of it,
and Mill was not desirous. He confounded <i>cost</i> with <i>value</i>. Considering
our intercourse it was natural he should give me a copy
of his book;&mdash;the devil a bit!' (Life by Bowring in Works, vol. x.
p. 498.) Then follows a letter to Ricardo, in which Bentham
compliments him on his political progress: 'I told Burdett you
had got down to <i>trienniality</i>, and were wavering between that and
annuality, where I could not help flattering myself you would
fix,&mdash;also, in respect of extent, down to <i>householders</i>, for which,
though I should prefer universality on account of its simplicity
and unexclusiveness, I myself should be glad to compound.' The
suggestion of stinginess made by Bentham in the passage quoted
is sufficiently rebutted by Bentham's own biographer, who tells us
Ricardo was one of those who guaranteed the funds for Bentham's
Chrestomathic School (Bentham, Works, x. p. 484), and by James
Mill (Biography, p. 191), when he speaks of Ricardo's unwillingness
to accept payment for his article (Sinking Fund) in the Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica on the grounds that, first, it was not worth payment,
second, payment was no part of his inducement to write it.</p>

<p>The influence of Bentham on Ricardo's general ways of thinking
is discussed elsewhere. In economical theory (if we judge Bentham
by his 'Manual of Political Economy,' which was written some
years before this time, though not published in England till long
afterwards) there was no more than a general agreement between
the two men.</p></div>

<p class="idt">I am pleased to learn that you are busy writing
with a view to immediate publication<a name="FNanchor_72_74" id="FNanchor_72_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_74" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. The public pay a

the cloud of ignorance and prejudice, which everywhere
exists on the subjects which have particularly engaged
your time and reflection. I hope your notes on Adam
Smith are in great forwardness, and that they will soon
follow the smaller publications which you are now preparing.
I expect that they will not only be very useful
in giving correct notions to the public, but also in calling
the attention of those who are well informed in the science
of political economy to many points which have hitherto
escaped their consideration.</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking that Lord Lauderdale was mistaken
(and I believe you hold the same opinion as him),
in supposing the farmer to lie under any particular disadvantage
from not having the monopoly of the home
market, whilst so many other trades were enjoying that
benefit. You will agree that the monopoly of the home
market is eventually of no great advantage to the trade
on which it is conferred. It is true that it raises the price
of the commodity by shutting out foreign competition, but
this is equally injurious to all consumers, and presses no
more on the farmer than on other trades. If monopolies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
tend to raise the price of labour, the inconvenience must
be suffered by all who employ labour, and will therefore
not be particularly injurious to the farmer or landlord. If
all the monopolies of the home market were immediately
abolished, there would be at least as much disposition to
import corn:&mdash;if so they do not interfere with the natural
course of the corn trade. Lord Lauderdale, with his opinion
of the effect of monopolies, is, I think, quite consistent in
recommending a duty on the importation of corn.</p>

<p>I thought you maintained that the high or low profits
on commerce were totally independent of the amount of
capital which might be employed on the land, consequently
that high profits might continue as long as commerce was
prosperous, whether that was for twenty or for a hundred
years. I now understand you to say, that the profits of
commerce may take the lead, and may regulate the profits
of agriculture for a period of some duration, possibly for
twenty years.</p>

<p>I have always allowed that under certain circumstances
profits on agriculture might be diverted from their regular
course for short periods, so that we only appear to differ
with respect to the duration of such profits; instead of
twenty years I should limit it to about four or five.</p>

<p>If with the same labour we could obtain double the
quantity of tin from the mines in Cornwall, after prices
had found the[ir l]evel, would the value of the whole mass
of commodities be increased in England? Should we obtain
the same quantity of deals from Norway in exchange for a
given quantity of tin as we now do? Although the mass
of commodities both in the markets of Norway and in those
of England would increase by the greater abundance of
tin, or of some other commodity, if the labour employed in
procuring tin were diverted to other objects, yet the
estimated value of all their commodities in corn, money,
or any article but tin, would, it appears to me, continue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
unaltered. It is sufficient that deals can be purchased
cheaper in Norway than elsewhere to determine a portion
of foreign trade to that quarter, although it should yield no
more profits than those of other trades.</p>

<p>On the supposition which you have made of a great
foreign demand for our raw produce, there can be no
question that more capital would be employed on the land,
and I think profits would fall. Such a demand cannot
exist in the present situation of the world. Raw produce
is always imported into the relatively rich country, and
never exported from it, but on occasions of dearth or
famine. I have no doubt that, if the free importation of
corn is allowed into this country, inasmuch as it will direct
foreign capital to foreign land, it will tend to lower foreign
profits, and if all the earth were cultivated <i>with equal skill</i>
up to the same standard, the rate of profits would be everywhere
the same, though the superior industry and ingenuity
of particular countries might secure to them a greater
abundance of other commodities....</p>

<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">I have now read with great attention your essay on
the rise and progress of Rent<a name="FNanchor_74_76" id="FNanchor_74_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_76" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>, with a view of selecting every
passage which might afford us subject for future discussion.
It is no praise to say that all the leading principles in it
meet with my perfect assent, and that I consider it as containing
many original views which are not only important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
as connected with rent, but with many other difficult points,
such as taxation, etc., etc.</p>

<p>I cannot, however, help regretting that you did not consider
separately the relations of rent with the profits of
stock and the wages of labour. By treating of the joint
effect of the two latter on rent you have, I think, not made
the subject so clear as it might have been made.</p>

<p>There are some parts in the essay with which I cannot
agree. One of these is the effects of improvements, whether
in the practice of agriculture or in the implements of husbandry,
on rent. They appear to me in their immediate
effects to be beneficial to the farmer only and not to
the landlord. All the augmented produce obtained, or
the saving in obtaining the same quantity of produce is, I
think, wholly to the advantage of the farmer, and that the
landlord only benefits remotely from it, as it may encourage
accumulation and the cultivation of poorer lands. I
think too that rents are in no case a creation of wealth;
they are always a part of the wealth already created, and
are enjoyed necessarily, but not on that account less beneficially
to the public interest, at the expense of the profits
of stock<a name="FNanchor_75_77" id="FNanchor_75_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_77" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.</p>

<p>Viewing rents in this light, it follows that I must withdraw
the concession which I was inclined to make when
you first started the question 'whether, in importing corn
at a cheaper price than we could grow it, the whole difference
of price was saved, or whether some abatement should
not be made from the advantage for the loss of rent?' as I
now decide[d]ly think that the whole difference of price
would be gained without any deduction whatever. The
arguments then of those who contend for a free trade in
corn remain in their original full force, as rents are always
withdrawn from the profits of stock. I will try, if I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
a little leisure, to put my thoughts on this subject on paper,
and shall attempt to show that the effects of a tax and of
rent are very different as far as regards importation. It
may be economical to grow corn if its price is raised
merely by taxation, as by importing it a part of the tax
would be wholly lost to the country [import]ing it. No
such consideration should influence us [with regar]d to
rent being lost.</p>

<p>I differ, as you know, as to the effects of taxation on
the growth of produce. You appear to me not quite consistent
in admitting, as you unequivocally do, that the last
portion of land cultivated yields nothing more than the
profits of stock, no rent, and yet to maintain that taxes on
necessaries or on raw produce fall on the landlord and not
on the consumer.</p>

<p>... I have paid Wettenhall &pound;2 8<i>s.</i> for two years' lists, but
it has since occurred to me that I paid him and you paid
me for one year, and therefore that only one year can be
due to him. If so, let me know, that I may get back
&pound;1 4<i>s.</i></p>

<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">I shall accept your kind invitation, and intend being
with you on Saturday evening at the usual time. We can
then talk over the points on which we differ. I will bring
with me the papers on which I have been busy since you
left London, and in which my objections are more fully
stated than can be done in the compass of a letter<a name="FNanchor_76_78" id="FNanchor_76_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_78" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>In the case of the Scotch farmers who made such large
profits on their capital during the latter part of their leases<a name="FNanchor_77_79" id="FNanchor_77_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_79" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>,
they appear to me to have been enjoying rent, arising not
from improvements in agriculture, but from poorer land
being taken into cultivation. If their leases had expired
sooner, rent would have been increased long before on those
farmers. It would be desirable to know what the rent on
those farms was when the lease was originally granted, or
rather what proportion it bore to the capital then employed
and what the proportion of rent is to the capital now employed.</p>

<p>The effects of monopoly cannot, I think, be felt till no
more land can be advantageously cultivated. You have
yourself said, and I very much admire the passage<a name="FNanchor_78_80" id="FNanchor_78_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_80" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>, that
the last portion of capital employed on the land yields only
the common profits of stock, and does not afford any rent.
If so, corn, like everything else, is regulated in its price by
the cost of production, and every other portion of capital
employed on the land is reduced to the same level of profits
only because no more capital can be employed with more
advantage, and all which it anywhere yields more is rent
and not profit.</p>

<p>I have read the Appendix<a name="FNanchor_79_81" id="FNanchor_79_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_81" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> also with great attention, and
cannot help thinking that you have quite thrown off the
character of impartiality to which, in the Observations, I
thought you fairly entitled. You are avowedly for restrictions
on importation; of that I do not complain. It is not
easy to estimate justly the dangers to which we may be
exposed. Those who are for an open trade in corn may
underrate them, and it is possible that you may overrate
them. It is a most difficult point to calculate these dangers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
at their fair value; but in an economical view, although
you have here and there allowed that we might be benefited
by importing cheap rather than by growing dear, you
point out many inconveniences which we should suffer
from the loss of agricultural capital and from other causes,
which would make it appear as if even economically you
thought we ought to import corn,&mdash;such is the approbation
with which you quote from Adam Smith of [<i>sic</i>] the benefits
of agriculture over commerce in increasing production<a name="FNanchor_80_82" id="FNanchor_80_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_82" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>,
and which I cannot help thinking is at variance with all
your general doctrines.</p>

<p>Your observations on the advantages (and therefore on
the injustice to other classes) which the stockholder would
reap from a low price of corn are, I think, very correct; but
I do not think these objections should stand in the way of
the general good. They, the stockholders, have at different
periods suffered much, and, if the sinking fund be now
appropriated to other services<a name="FNanchor_81_83" id="FNanchor_81_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_83" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>, another striking injustice
will be added to the long list. I meant to write only a few

<p class="idt">My acquaintance lies so little amongst political
economists that I have very few opportunities of knowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
whether what you consider as my peculiar opinions have
any supporters, or indeed are read or attended to. As for
my own judgment on the subject, it is perhaps too partial
to merit attention; but after my best efforts not to be
biassed in favour of my own opinions, I continue to think
them correct.</p>

<p>I would indeed rather modify what I said concerning the
stationary state of the prices of commodities under all the
variations of the price of corn, either from wealth on the
one hand or the importation from foreign countries or improvements
in agriculture on the other. I made no allowance
for the altered value of the raw material in all manufactured
goods<a name="FNanchor_82_84" id="FNanchor_82_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_84" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>. They would, I think, be subject to a
variation in price not on account of increased or diminished
wages, but on account of the rise or fall in the price of the
raw produce which enters into their composition, and which
in some commodities cannot be inconsiderable. It is a
matter of mortification to me that my execution has been
so faulty; I was too much in a hurry, and have not made
my meaning intelligible even to those who are familiar with
such subjects, much less to those who skim over these
matters.</p>

<p>Since I have seen you I received a note from Mr. Edward
West, who is the author writing under the title of a Fellow
of University College; he speaks in favour of my opinions
of course, because they are very similar to his own. I have
read his book with attention, and I find that his views
agree very much with my own. He is a barrister, a young
man, and appears very fond of the study of political economy.
Mr. Brougham has, I think he said, promised to
introduce him to you. Mr. Jacob<a name="FNanchor_83_85" id="FNanchor_83_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_85" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> has handled both him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and me rather roughly; but he will not condescend to
argue with us. I shall be very easy if he is the most formidable
opponent that is to attack me, for he seems totally
ignorant of the scientific part of the subject.</p>

<p>The opposition to the bill<a name="FNanchor_84_86" id="FNanchor_84_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_86" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> is more formidable than I
expected, but they appear so determined in the House of
Commons, that I suppose it will finally pass. I regret that
the people should have proceeded to acts of riots and outrage.
I am too much a friend to good order to wish to
succeed through such means, besides that I am persuaded
that they hurt rather than promote the object which they
and I have in view.</p>

<p>I wish you could have dined with me on Saturday.
I expect Mr. Phillips<a name="FNanchor_85_87" id="FNanchor_85_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_87" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and Mr. Dumont; it would be a
very agreeable surprise to me if you should join our party.
Perhaps you may be inclined to come to London and wil[l]
take a bed in Brook Street. Do if you can [and] do not
think it necessary to write on purpose to say you cannot.
I shall fully depend on your staying with us when you
come to the next club.</p>

<p>Sir F. Burdett and some others think that the high price
of our corn is owing to enormous taxation, and that it ought
not nor cannot fall without oppression to the landholders
till our debt is diminished. If I could convince myself
that any part of the price of corn was owing to taxation, I
should be in favour of a protecting duty to that amount.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
But, if he were right, the high price would not be accompanied
by high rents or by the cultivation of inferior lands.
These I consider as unequivocal marks of the high price
being caused by wealth and a scarcity of fertile land.
Indeed my theory leads me to think that no taxes but
those directly on the land or on its produce would raise
the price of corn, and even such taxes would have no effect
if all exportable commodities were taxed in the same degree,
for a tax on exportable commodities in a country
which imports corn does not act very differently from a
duty on the importation of corn. Kind regards to Mrs.
Malthus.</p>

<p class="idt">I have read Mr. Torrens' pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_87_89" id="FNanchor_87_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_89" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and think it on
the whole a very able performance. I differ with him in
most of his views in chap. 2, part 2, with many of the 3rd
chap., and with a few in the remainder of the work. I am
glad to hear that you are going to make some observations
on it<a name="FNanchor_88_90" id="FNanchor_88_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_90" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. I think he is an adversary worthy of your pen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and the friends of truth cannot fail to profit by the discussion.
With regard to any remarks on my opinions, you
must be governed by your own discretion. If those
opinions are wrong, I should like to see them refuted, but,
thinking as I do that they are in all essential points
founded on correct principles, I ask for no mercy. I do
not care how severely they are attacked; there is nothing
you could say of them which would hurt me, if what you
said did not express contempt, and that I know you do not
feel for me. Act therefore towards me as if I were a
perfect stranger, and notice me or not as you think best.</p>

<p>I cannot hesitate in agreeing with you that, if from
a rise in the relative value of corn less is paid for fixed
capital and wages, more of the produce must remain for the
landlord and farmer together; this is indeed self-evident,
but is really not the matter in dispute between us, and
I cannot help thinking that you overlook some of the
circumstances most important connected with the question.
My opinion is that corn can only permanently rise
in its exchangeable value when the real expenses<a name="FNanchor_89_91" id="FNanchor_89_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_91" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> of its
production increase. If 5000 quarters of gross produce
cost 2500 quarters for the expenses of wages, etc., and
10,000 quarters cost double, or 5000 quarters, the exchangeable
value of corn would be the same; but, if the 10,000
quarters cost 5500 quarters for the expenses of wages, etc.,
then the price would rise 10 p.c., because such would be
the amount of the increased expenses. A rise of the price
of corn and a fall in the corn price of labour is [<i>sic</i>] in my
opinion incompatible, unless it be owing to something in
the currency; and it is not necessary to enquire here what
effects that would produce. Observe that I do not question
that each individual labourer may receive a less corn price
of labour, because I believe that would be the case, but
I question whether the whole corn amount of wages, etc.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
paid for the cultivation of the land can be diminished with
an increase of the exchangeable value of corn. If no more
labourers were employed and the price of corn rose, your
proposition could not be disputed; but the cause of the
rise of the price of corn is solely on account of the increased
expense of production.</p>

<p>I have lost Lord Lauderdale's pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_90_92" id="FNanchor_90_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_92" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, or rather it has
been taken from my office. If I can get another, it sha[ll]
accompany this. The improvement[s] in agriculture I believe
have had more effect in kee[ping] down r[ents] than
we have ever imagined. On my theory they fully account
for rents being no higher; on yours they would tell the
other way.</p>

<p>I meant to reproach you when I saw you [for<a name="FNanchor_91_93" id="FNanchor_91_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_93" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>] speaking
of Mr. Jacob's pamphlet with so much [praise<a href="#Footnote_91_93" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>] as you did
when Mr. Basevi<a name="FNanchor_92_94" id="FNanchor_92_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_94" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> asked your opinion of it. I am glad you
allow he is very deficient in scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>You will see by what I have said that a rise in the price
of corn is always in my opinion accompanied by a less
material surplus produce; but it may be of equal value as
compared with other things. Of this produce the landlord
gets so large a share that in spite of the rise of produce
the situation of the farmer is constantly getting worse.</p>

<p class="idt">If your statement<a name="FNanchor_93_95" id="FNanchor_93_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_95" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> was correct, this extravagant
consequence would follow from it: That in proportion as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
population increased and worse land was brought under
cultivation, the proportion of produce to the corn expenses of
procuring it would increase. If we now had twenty millions
of quarters with an expense of five millions of quarters, we
should when we expended ten millions of quarters obtain
more than forty<a name="FNanchor_94_96" id="FNanchor_94_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_96" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>, notwithstanding that in the latter period
many more than double the quantity of hands were employed
in cultivation in consequence of the poorer quality
of the land. If this be true, the principle of population is
false, because the more you increase the people, the greater
surplus of abundance will appear. Your statement is however
very ingenious, and carries a great deal of plausibility
with it; but I think you err in supposing it possible that
the proportion of the whole corn expenditure to the produce
obtained can fall, with an increase of the price of corn.
The two are incompatible; either the whole corn expenses
of production will be increased or not. If they be, the price
of corn will rise; but, if they be not, I can see no reason
for a rise in the price of corn. I admit that it is only the
last portion of capital employed on the land which will be
attended with an increased corn expense; but, unless it
renders the whole produce together at an increased expense,
the price of produce will not rise. Suppose the produce
of the country ten millions of quarters with the price
at &pound;4 per quarter, the number of labourers employed two-and-a-half
millions, each receiving two quarters of corn
annually as wages. Suppose too that the population increases
and five millions of quarters more are required, but
that it cannot be obtained with less labour than that of two
millions of men. If we suppose the price to increase in proportion
to the number of men employed, it will rise to &pound;4 16<i>s.</i>,
because to raise ten millions of quarters an average of three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
millions of men would be now required instead of two-and-a-half
millions. Suppose now each man to consume one
quarter annually for food and to exchange the remainder
for other necessaries. Fourteen bushels will be sufficient
wages for him<a name="FNanchor_95_97" id="FNanchor_95_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_97" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>; the expenditure of corn for wages will then
be for fifteen millions of produce 7.875.000, and for ten
millions 5.250.000. Before, it was only five millions; consequently
the proportion of surplus produce has diminished.</p>

<p>In making this calculation I have very much favoured
your view of the question, because the price of corn would
not, I think, rise in proportion to the greater number of
men employed but to the greater amount of wages paid;
it would not therefore rise to &pound;4 16<i>s</i>., but to &pound;4 4<i>s</i>., because
as 5 : 5&frac14; : : &pound;4 : &pound;4 4<i>s</i>. But, if the price was only &pound;4 4<i>s</i>.,
more corn would be required by the labourer than fourteen
bushels, that calculation being founded on a greater exchangeable
value of corn. It appears too that your statement
if true does not account for the less proportion of the
population now emp[loyed upon] the land, because you
always suppose more men to [be employed] but at less
corn wages. It can never happen, I think, that profits can
fall and encourage the cultivation of poor [land in] the
manner assumed in my table without a rise in the price of
corn. It is by the rise of the price of corn that all other
profits are regulated to agricultural profits. If the price of
corn remained low, money wages would not rise, and
general profits could not fall. If it be true that capital
has become more and more productive on the land, it can,
I think, only be accounted for on the supposition that great
improvements have taken place in agriculture, and that
wages have been kept moderate by the improvements in
those manufactures which supply the poor with the necessaries
on which a part of their wages are expended.</p>

<p>What a dreadful change in our political horizon has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>

<p class="idt">On no subject that we have been lately discussing
have we so materially differed as on the one now occupying
our attention. Your position, if established, would, I think,
overturn both your theory of rent and population, for
I understand you to maintain that the higher the price of
corn rises, in consequence of more men being employed on
the poorer land, the greater will be, not only the surplus
produce after paying the labourers, but the ratio of that
surplus produce to the whole capital employed on the land.
If this be true there is no check to the increase of population,
and food can be increased in a ratio exceeding that at
which mankind increase. Your statement requires that
with every additional labourer not only an equal increase
but a greater increase of surplus produce should be obtained.
More labourers may then be employed without limit, and
rent and profit together must not only increase, but increase
in a geometrical progression. I am sure I am correct in
thus stating your proposition, because if as you say the
whole corn expense of production per quarter will be
diminished with every rise of price, the surplus must
increase in a geometrical ratio with the capital employed.
If you meant only that the surplus produce would increase
with every accumulation of capital on the land, though in
a diminishing ratio to the capital employed on the land,
that is not only advanced, but strenuously maintained as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the groundwork of my theory, and is the basis also on which
my table is formed. You have misapprehended a passage in
my last letter. I certainly never said, nor ever thought,
that any good reason could be given for an increased number
of men being required to produce precisely the same
quantity of corn from precisely the same land. What
I said was that, if at one period the number of labourers
required to produce ten millions of quarters of corn was
two-and-a-half millions of men, and at another, in consequence
of increased demand, fifteen millions of quarters
could not be produced with a portion of worse land at a less
cost of labour than that of four-and-a-half millions, at this
latter period a production of ten millions would require
three millions of men, because fifteen is to four-and-a-half
as ten to three, and if we supposed the price of corn
under such circumstances to increase in the proportion
of 2&frac12; to 3, a supposition much more favourable to your
view of the question than we should be obliged to concede,
yet that it would not support the conclusions to which you
arrive, but, on the contrary, would prove my theory to be
the correct one. If the calculation had been made, as you
think would have been more correct, on an increase from
ten millions to ten-and-a-half millions, the result would
have been the same, but we should be puzzled with the
decimals or fractions which must be employed on such a
supposition. I agree with you 'that the natural price of
corn depends entirely upon the price of the last addition,
and it does not matter whether with regard to the old land
a capital yields 50 per cent. rent and profit or 20 per cent.
In either case the price of corn on such land has nothing
to do with the cost of production.' I do not see how the
admission of this fact can assist your argument, which
relates only to the ratio of the surplus produce to the whole
capital employed.</p>

<p>I cannot conceive by what argument you could shew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
that it might be possible that the addition of another
labourer on the land would not pay his expenses, although
not more than a quarter of the population were employed
upon the land. Allowing, as I most fully do, that
no pressure can destroy rents, yet as the last portions of
capital employed on the land pay no rent, it is to me
inconceivable that there would be no inducement to employ
more labourers whilst their average production should be
three times more food than they could themselves consume.
If the whole of this surplus, after maintaining in the most
frugal manner the owners of stock, were absorbed by the
landlords as rent, they would increase their revenue, and
employ more labourers on the land, if any among them
saved any part of his income and lent it at the common
rate of interest. I am sorry you do not come to town for
the next club.</p>

<p class="ralign1">
<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>27th March, 1815</i>.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">No particular event which I recollect ever occasioned
so great a gloom as the late lamentable reverse.
At present we have the most dismal forebodings of war
and its consequences on our finances; the truth is our
courage is not screwed up to the proper pitch; like everything
else, we shall be easy under our new situation in
another fortnight. I am glad, however, to turn my attention
to other subjects.</p>

<p>I have observed in the bullion pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_97_99" id="FNanchor_97_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_99" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> that many
who say they consider money only as a commodity, and
subject to the same laws of variation in value from demand
and supply as other commodities, seldom proceed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
far in their reasoning about money without showing that
they really consider money as something peculiar, varying
from causes totally different from those which affect other
commodities. Do you not fall into this error when you say,
'In the first place all depends upon the relation between
corn and other commodities, and, as labour and corn enter
into the prices of all commodities, the difference between
corn and other commodities cannot possibly increase in
any proportion to the increase in the money price of
corn'? If money be a commodity does [<i>sic</i>] not corn and
labour enter into its price or value? And, if they do, why
should not money vary as compared with corn and labour
by the same law as all other commodities do? As far as
this question regards the importation of corn, you are
much more interested than I am in maintaining the uniform
value of commodities, because if the rise of the price
of corn and labour will as you contend raise the price of
our commodities, this is an additional reason why we
should not impose restrictions on the importation of corn,
as it will subject us to a decided disadvantage in our competition
with foreigners for the sale of our commodities.</p>

<p>Not however to dwell on this very essential point, I agree
with you that a rise in the price of corn occasions a
different distribution of the produce from the old land.
It does this by lowering profits. Instead of a manufacturer
having it in his power to maintain a servant or
mechanic who may contribute to his enjoyment, that
power will be transferred to the landlord, and this will
arise from the lower corn value of manufactured goods.
Indeed I see no limit to the fall of the corn value of
goods but the impossibility of manufacturing them with
any the least return of profit, and this will not happen
till the landlord has appropriated to himself in the form of
rent nearly the whole surplus produce of the land. It
appears to me that the progress of wealth, whilst it in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>creases
accumulation, has a natural tendency to produce
this effect and is as certain as the principle of gravitation.</p>

<p>You have, I think, totally changed your proposition.
You before contended that, in consequence of increasing
wealth and the cultivation of poorer land, the whole <i>corn</i>
cost of production on the land would bear a <i>less</i> proportion
to the whole <i>corn</i> produce; but now you say that the
<i>money</i> cost of production on the land will bear a less
proportion to the <i>money</i> value of the whole produce. Between
these propositions there is a very material difference,
as the latter might be true at the very time that the
former was false. To admit what you now contend for
would not affect my theory, as, though it would prove
that the landlord and tenant (together) got more money
revenue, or, if you will, a greater proportion of money
revenue as compared to the money capital employed, yet
the tenant might and I think would get a less proportion,
and therefore the rate of profits would fall. Such a state
of price [<i>sic</i>] is quite compatible with a greater proportion
of men, as compared with the produce obtained, being
employed on the land; but it is wholly irreconcileable
with the net corn produce bearing a larger proportion
to the gross corn produce, which was the principle before
contended for. I agree with you that the increased price
of corn in the order of things is rather a cause than a
consequence of a greater than the usual number of men
being employed to obtain the same quantity of produce
from new land, because profits from such an employment
of capital may be higher than other profits; but this difference
of profit may be owing to a general fall in the
rate of profits on other concerns rather than to the actual
elevation of the profits on land; and I am of opinion that
a rise in the price of corn always lowers general profits
by increasing wages. I can in no way satisfy myself that
general profits can rise with a rising price of corn and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
fall with falling prices, unless they are raised or lowered
by diminishing or increasing wages, and then they can be
but of short duration. In the ordinary course of things,
as a high price of corn attends a state of progression,
wages of labour will be really high, and profits cannot rise
because of wages being low.</p>

<p>I am decidedly of opinion that Torrens<a name="FNanchor_98_100" id="FNanchor_98_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_100" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> has treated
you unjustly in his remarks in the preface of his book.
If I recollect, you acknowledged an alteration in your
opinion respecting the corn laws, since you wrote your
essay on population, in your 'Observations on the Corn
Laws.' I think too that you have always held the opinion
you now do that the difference between the value of gold
and paper was partly owing to the rise of the value of
gold. Is not his criticism very much strained as to the
use of the word depreciation? But, if he be right in all,
the instances are much too few to justify his severe
observation. At the Geological Club<a name="FNanchor_99_101" id="FNanchor_99_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_101" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> his book was
spoken of the other day with great approbation. Mr.
Blake<a name="FNanchor_100_102" id="FNanchor_100_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_102" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and Mr. Greenough<a name="FNanchor_101_103" id="FNanchor_101_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_103" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> think that he has exhausted
the subject, and that his arguments cannot be controverted.
I should think that he is very generally read. 'If I would
lay a tax on foreign corn,' you ask, 'on account of a tax
on our own, does not the same principle apply to the
indirect taxes that raise the price of labour?' I think
not, because a tax on corn will raise the price of corn
twice, once on account of the tax, and a second time on
account of the rise of wages; but, as this second rise is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
common to all things in which labour enters, and will be
corrected by a new value of money, it will not be of long
duration. The indirect taxes which only raise the wages
of labour produce, I think, the same effects as the second
rise in the price of corn, of which I have just been
speaking. Whenever a tax bore with unequal effect on
the land, when it did not affect labour bestowed in other
employments, a countervailing duty on importation should,
I think, be also imposed. I fear I cannot be with you
on Saturday. If you do not hear from me by Wednesday's
post, conclude that I cannot leave home....</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Robert Torrens, the soldier economist, began his
literary career with 'The Economist Refuted' (1808), in answer
to William Spence, who in 1807 tried to persuade his countrymen
that Napoleon's blockade mattered little to them, Britain being
'independent of commerce.' In the winter of 1810-11, Torrens was
Major Commandant of the Royal Marines, doing garrison duty on
the island of Anholt in the Kattegat. The frost gave him time to
re-read his Adam Smith and write his 'Essay on Money and
Paper Currency' (publ. 1812). In his 'Essay on the External Corn
Trade' (see above, page 65), Torrens characterizes the writings of
Malthus as suggestive and candid and full of 'facts,' but ill-reasoned
and inconsistent. Mr. Malthus, he says, scarcely ever embraced a
principle which he did not subsequently abandon; his Essay on
Population was a plagiarism from Wallace; and he refuted it
himself by introducing the influence of Moral Restraint; in
regard to Corn Bounties and in regard to the Currency, his later
writings have contradicted his earlier. (Pref. pp. viii. to xii.)
Torrens compared the Political Economy of Malthus with that of
Ricardo, greatly to the advantage of the latter, in his 'Production
of Wealth' (1821). See 'Malthus and his Work,' pp. 265-6.

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">You think that my theory of a diminishing rate of
profit in consequence of being obliged to cultivate poorer
lands is affected by my admission that there will be a
greater quantity of surplus produce and a greater money
value from the old land. This would be true if any part
of either the additional quantity or additional value belonged
to the owner of stock. You, however, expressly say
that this additional value or quantity 'will remain to the
farmer and landlord.['] Before my theory is affected it
must be shown that the whole will not remain with the
landlord, as, if the farmer gets no share of it, his rate of
profits cannot be raised.</p>

<p>I agree with you that, when the exchangeable value of
corn rises, 'the whole quantity of corn in the country will
exchange for a greater number of coats than before, and
consequently that there will be both the power and will
to purchase, with the raw produce of the country, a greater
quantity of manufactured and foreign commodities.' In a
progressive country I can easily conceive this power and
will to be doubled or trebled, as well as the commodities
on which they are exercised; but this admission does not
affect the question of profits. There may be a great demand
for home and foreign commodities without their
price being permanently raised, as no new difficulties may
attend their production. When America becomes populous
and wealthy in the same proportion as the most
wealthy country of Europe, will not her corn exchange at
a higher value both for money and commodities, although it
will have much increased in quantity? Will not all
foreign and home commodities in America be double or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
treble their present amount, yet will not the profits of
stock be less there than they now are? On this question
I could not have thought that the slightest doubt could
exist; all theory, all experience is in favour of this
opinion.</p>

<p>Whilst the labour of ten persons employed on land
paying no rent can produce one hundred quarters of wheat,
it appears to me possible and probable that one-third
more labour might profitably be employed on that land,
not indeed in producing only one hundred quarters of wheat,
but an additional quantity more than the additional
labourers would consume. Whilst the labour of ten men
can produce one hundred quarters of wheat, it is difficult to
suppose profits only ten per cent., and more difficult to conceive
that many more men might not be profitably employed
in increasing the produce off such land. In theory,
land which yields no rent, according to your supposition,
would have more and more capital profitably expended on
it, whilst the additional quantity of produce obtained exceeded
[the] quantity paid to the additional labourers.
Capital [might] be so expended, whilst the profits of stock
gave any return, not ten per cent. but one per cent. or
a half per cent.</p>

<p>No doubt money varies more slowly than other commodities
for the reason you mention; nevertheless its
value, like every other foreign commodity, depends on the
labour and expense of bringing it to market.</p>

<p>I expect some friends to dine with me on Saturday, and
on Monday I am engaged out to dinner; yet, if the
weather is tolerably fine, I will be with you by the time
you leave chapel on Sunday, but I must get home next
day. If this is not quite convenient, pray let me know.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">You, I think, agree with Mr. Torrens that a rise in
the price of corn will be followed by a rise in the price of
home commodities; but your theory requires that there
should be no rise in the price of those commodities on
which the wages of labour are expended, for, if they rose
in the same proportion as corn, there could be no fall in
the corn wages of labour. Is it not, however, very improbable
that all manufactures should rise at home, and yet
that those on which [the wages of] labour are expended
should not rise? Is not the price of soap, candles, etc.,
though foreign commodities<a name="FNanchor_102_104" id="FNanchor_102_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_104" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>, necessarily affected by the
rise in the price of those home goods which are given in
exchange for them. Mr. Torrens' theory, however, on this
part of the subject appears to me defective, as I think that
the price of commodities will be very slightly affected
either by a rise or fall in the price of corn. If so, every
rise in the price of corn must affect profits on manufactures;
and it is impossible that agricultural profits can materially
deviate from them. I will, however, suppose that you and
Mr. Torrens are correct, and that commodities do rise in
price with every increased price of corn. The value of
fixed capital as well as of circulating capital employed on
the land will then rise also; and, although the money value
of the produce should be increased on the old land, it will
still bear the same proportion to the money value of the
capital employed; and, as this produce will be divided in
different proportions between the landlord and the farmer,
the rate of profits of the latter will fall. For the purpose
of examining the effects, let us suppose that all commodi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>ties
rise, with the rise of the price of corn, excepting those
only on which the wages of labour are expended, and that
in consequence the corn wages of labour fall. Suppose
the price of corn &pound;4, and that on the old land the labour
of eight men was necessary to raise eighty quarters of
corn, that no rent was paid, and that each labourer had
eight quarters annually for his wages, of which one half
was expended on commodities. The gain of the farmer,
when the price was &pound;4, would be &pound;64 or sixteen quarters,
and, besides his fixed capital, horses, seed, etc., he would
require the value of sixty-four quarters, or &pound;256, to pay
the annual wages of his labourers; consequently his profits
would be in the proportion of &pound;25 to &pound;100 of wages, for
256:64::100:25. Now, suppose corn to rise to &pound;4 10<i>s.</i>,
wages would vary only 10<i>s.</i> on four quarters, and consequently
would rise to &pound;34 annually per man, or &pound;272 on
the old land; but the eighty quarters of corn would sell
for &pound;360, leaving a produce of &pound;88 to be divided between
farmer and landlord; and 88 would be to 272 as 32
to 100.</p>

<p>But on the new land the labour of eight men and a half
might be required to obtain eighty quarters or &pound;360; the
labour of eight-and-a-half men would cost, at &pound;34 each,
&pound;289; consequently the profit would be &pound;71, which is to the
whole expense of &pound;360 as &pound;19&middot;7 to &pound;100.</p>

<div class='center'>
<table class="nobord" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<p>It appears then that the profit on new land, which
regulates the profit on all other land, would be 19&middot;7 per
cent. when the price of corn was &pound;4 10<i>s.</i> It was 25 per
cent. when the price was &pound;4.</p>

<p>If indeed under the same circumstances we had supposed
the price of corn to rise to &pound;6, then profits would be in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>creased,
and would be much more than 25 per cent.; but
some adequate cause must be shown for [such] rise, and
it cannot be arbitrarily assumed. Your theory supposes
too what is impossible, that the demand for manufactures
[could] increase in the same proportion as the demand for
[corn] at the very time that more men are employed on the
land to obtain a less proportion of produce. The whole
appears to me a labyrinth of difficulties; one is no sooner
got over than another presents itself, and so on in endless
succession. Let me entreat you to give my simple doctrine
fair consideration, and you must allow that it accounts for
all the phenomena in an easy natural manner.</p>

<p>I yesterday met Mr. Smyth<a name="FNanchor_103_105" id="FNanchor_103_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_105" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>, your friend, and Mr. Torrens
at Mr. Phillips'. I passed a very pleasant day. Mr. Smyth
was exceedingly agreeable. I like him very much. The
corn question was occasionally introduced, and I had an opportunity
of stating some of my objections to Mr. Torrens'
theory. I have no reason to think that I convinced him.
I defended the use of the word depreciation in the sense
[in] which you had used it; and I believe I had every one
with me. I fancy that his arguments in his book on currency
are founded on the sense in which he uses the word.
We spoke on the other points of difference between him
and you. Mr. Smyth, Mr. Phillips, and Mr. Torrens have
agreed to dine with me on Wednesday, which has induced
me to write to you a day or two sooner than I otherwise
should have done that I might express my wish that you
would join us. If you will, we will dine as late as you
please. There will be a bed at your service, and I need
not say that you will add considerably to my pleasure.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In many of his speeches, e.g. June 12, 1822, Ricardo
refers to the ambiguity of the word 'depreciation'. He himself
always uses it to indicate that the currency had fallen below its
own standard, as e.g. when coins are clipped. Others used it of a
change in the <i>value</i> of the currency as purchasing a larger or a
smaller quantity of goods. A currency might be depreciated in
the first sense when it was actually, through counteracting causes,
the opposite (or appreciated) in the second. Malthus, in Edinburgh
Review, Feb. 1811, had used it in the first sense. (See pp.
341, 356, 365.) Torrens, in his 'Essay on Money,' 1812, had used
it in the second. (See pp. 98, 99.) The word 'appreciation'
occurs in Tooke's 'High and Low Prices' (1823), Part I. p. 76.
Tooke himself distinguishes depreciation of the Currency (the first
of the above senses) from depreciation of Money (the second of
them); (l. c. p. 8.)</p></div>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">I was sorry you could not join our party on Wednesday.
Mr. Smyth has left a pleasing impression on the
minds of all those who met him, and I had every reason to
confirm me in the favourable opinion which I had formed
of him at our first meeting. Mr. Torrens is a very gentlemanly
man. He had sent me his book on bullion before
he came, and I fear that too much of the conversation was
bestowed on the differences between his opinion and mine
on the subject of paper currency and the exchanges. The
latter he does not appear to me correctly to understand.
I insisted on the consistency of your former and present
opinions on the bullion question, and asked him from whence
he had derived his knowledge of your views on that subject.
He said that Dr. Crombie<a name="FNanchor_104_106" id="FNanchor_104_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_106" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and you had met pur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>posely
to discuss the question, and from him he had understood
that you ascribed the whole effects on the price of
bullion to the abundance of paper. He, as well as Monsieur
Say, finds it difficult to support his opinions and answer
objections in conversation&mdash;he says all such discussions
should be carried on in writing....</p>

<p>On Saturday I shall meet you at the King of Clubs, to
which I am invited by Mr. Whishaw, and on Sunday I wish
you and Mrs. Malthus will oblige Mrs. Ricardo and me
with your company to dinner. If you can I will ask Mr.
Whishaw and Mr. Smyth to meet you. Perhaps too you
will breakfast with me on Saturday or Sunday morning.</p>

<p>It appears to me that my table is applicable to all cases
in which the relative price of corn rises from more labour
being required to produce it, and under no other circumstances
can there be a rise, however great the demand may
be, unless commodities fall in value from less labour being
required for their production. It is not probable that the
relative price of corn will fall so low with an abundant
capital in the country as when capital was very limited,
but, if it could, the same effects on profits and on rent
would follow, as it would demonstrate that land only of the
best quality was in cultivation. You agree with me that
if a large tract of rich land were added to the Island it
would restore the state contemplated in my table. Though
we agree in the conclusion we differ materially in our
opinion of the means by which it would be brought about.
You think that 'before any fall of price had taken place
capital would be removing fast from the old land, <i>and from
manufactures</i>,'&mdash;I think that capital would go from the old
land to manufactures, because a given quantity of food only
being required, that quantity could be raised on the rich
land added to the Island with much less capital than was
employed on the old, and consequently all the surplus
would go to [manu]factures to procure other enjoyments for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the so[ciety<a name="FNanchor_105_107" id="FNanchor_105_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_107" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>], and profits on the land would rise at the expense
of the rent of the landlord, whilst the cheaper price
of corn would raise the profits on all manufacturing capital.
I confess it appears to me impossible that under the circumstances
you have supposed the relative value of corn
would fall, not from the facility of procuring it, but from a
rise in the value of manufactures. You suppose that corn
would remain at the same price whilst manufactures rose
in price,&mdash;I on the contrary think that the price of manufactures
would continue nearly stationary, whilst the price
of corn would fall. Is not this the natural consequence of
more capital being employed on manufactures and less on
agriculture? Have you not too uniformly supported the
opinion that a fall in the price of corn will occasion a fall
in the price of commodities? If they act on each other as
you think, but to which I do not agree, how can manufactures
rise in price with a stationary price of corn? I should
have thought that on your principles such an effect would
be deemed impossible.</p>

<span class="smcap">Upper Brook Street</span>, <i>27th June, 1815</i>.</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">I have been for two or three days at Tunbridge
Wells, and have been agreeably surprised to-day on my
arrival in London, to hear of the great events which are
taking place in France in consequence of the great victory
obtained by the Duke of Wellington and his brave army
over Bonaparte. With the deposition of Bonaparte I hope
there may be no other obstacles to peace, and that we may
at length be rewarded for the blood and treasure which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
have expended with a long period of tranquil[l]ity, which I
have no doubt will also prove a long period of prosperity.
I think with Mr. Whitbread<a name="FNanchor_106_108" id="FNanchor_106_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_108" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> that great credit is due to
ministers for the energy which they have displayed in the
prosecution of this contest. Having determined on war,
their preparations have been on such a scale as to give from
the commencement the best hopes of success, and we appear
at last to have adopted the wise policy of making one grand
effort in preference to a series of puny efforts, each just
sufficient to keep the contest alive without making the
least advance to its ultimate object.</p>

<p>The effect on the price of Omnium has been no more
than what might have been expected. I am sorry that you
have not profited by the rise. As for myself, I have all my
stock, by which I mean I have all my money[,] invested in
Stock; and this is as great an advantage as ever I expect
or wish to make by a rise. I have been a considerable
gainer by the loan<a name="FNanchor_107_109" id="FNanchor_107_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_109" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>; in the first place by replacing the stock
which I had sold before the contract with the minister [<i>sic</i>]
at a much lower price, secondly by a moderate gain on such
part of the loan as I ventured to take over and above my
stock. This portion I sold at a premium of from 3 to 5 per
cent., and I have every reason to be well contented. Perhaps
no loan was ever more generally profitable to the Stock
Exchange.</p>

<p>Now for a little of our old subject. It appears to me
that there are two causes which may cause a rise of prices,
one the depreciation of money, the other the difficulty of
producing. The latter can in no case be advantageous to a
society. It is always a sign of prosperity but never the
cause of it. Depreciation of money may be beneficial, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>cause
it generally favours that class who are disposed to
accumulate, but I should say that it augmented riches by
diminishing happiness, that it was advantageous only by
occasioning a great pressure on the labouring classes and on
those who lived on fixed incomes. You and I concur in this
opinion, for you say you are convinced that there are unobserved
advantages attending the high price of corn and
labour 'when not arising solely from difficulty of production,'
[by] which I think you imply that no such advantages
attend high prices if attended with difficulty of
production.</p>

<p>This opinion is, however, a little at variance with that
which you have long been supporting, for you have said
that the high price of corn and labour in this country at
this time was an advantage, although it is universally
allowed that that high price is mainly owing to difficulty of
production. The farmers and shopkeepers may suffer very
general distress from a sudden and general fall of prices;
but I hold that this would be no criterion by which to judge
of the general or permanent prosperity of a country.</p>

<p>The accounts in which I am at present engaged will
I fear keep me in London till the very latter end of July.
I shall very much regret if you quit Bath without my
seeing you. I quite depended on having a visit from you
at Gatcomb this year, and I yet hope that it may be accomplished.
I shall certainly leave London the very earliest
day possible.</p>

<p>The price of labour in America appears to me enormously
high as compared with the price of wheat; but
we should not fail to remember how very low the exchangeable
value of wheat is there, and how much of it
must be given for the manufactured necessaries and comforts
of life....</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">I bore with great patience the fatigues of the last
fortnight in London, in the hope that on my arrival at Gatcomb
I should have the pleasure of your company for a few
days previously to your return to London. It was a great
disappointment to me to learn that you would be travelling
to London the very day after I quitted it, and I see little
prospect of having a visit from you here for some time to
come, as your convenience or inclination will probably lead
you to a different part of the country next year.</p>

<p>I most cordially join with you in the wish that the
victory of the Duke of Wellington will be the means of
giving Europe some permanent repose. There appears every
probability that it will be attended with that happy effect,
and I should hope that the late stormy times will afford
instruction both to sovereigns and people, and will secure
the world from the evils of anarchy as well as from those
of tyranny and despotism.</p>

<p>David's ill health has induced us to take him from the
Charterhouse....</p>

<p>Mr. Clerk, a neighbour of mine here in Gloucestershire
and who is brother to the East India Director of that name,
has just sent his son George to the East India College, and
knowing my intimacy with you has called upon me to
request me to write to you on behalf of his son, that in case
he may st[and] in need of any friendly advice or assistance
you [would have] the goodness to give it to him. I hope
[I] am not taking too great a liberty in asking you to comply
with his father's wishes.</p>

<p>The immense concerns in business which I have lately
had on my mind had nearly banished all consideration of
subjects connected with political economy from it. Those
concerns are now settled, but they have given me incessant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
work in arranging and balancing my accounts ever since
I have been here. I recur now, however, with pleasure to
corn, labour, and bullion. A really high price of corn is
always an evil; in this opinion I think you would concur,
because it is always occasioned by difficulty of production.
I know of no other cause, and you allow difficulty of production
not to be desirable in itself. In our own case the
high bullion price of corn is not wholly owing to the barrenness
of the land to be taken into cultivation, but from whatever
cause it has arisen it cannot, I think, have enabled us
to grant greater subsidies than we should otherwise have
done, for subsidies as well as all services performed for us
are paid for by the produce of the land and labour of
the people of England. It surely is a palpable contradiction
to say that our power of commanding services is
increased, whilst our productions with which those services
are paid are diminished. The principle may be true when
confined to a few commodities of which we either have a
monop[o]ly or peculiar facilities in the production of them,
but as a general preposition it appears to me to be at
variance with the best established doctrines.</p>

<p>If a free trade in corn were allowed with America I should
not expect that the prices would differ more, here and there,
than the expenses and profits of sending it;&mdash;as it is I am
surprised the price should be so high. A high money price
of wages is I think quite natural.</p>

<p class="idt">Nothing could be more unlucky than our missing
each other as we did this year. I should think there
would be no obstacle to our leaving town a little earlier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
next year, when I hope we shall at length have the
pleasure of seeing Mrs. Malthus and you at Gatcomb.</p>

<p>It is the general remark in our part of the country
that a finer season was never remembered. The rain, of
which we have certainly had a deficiency, has generally
come at night, and the days which have followed have
been beautiful. The temptation to enjoy it has been so
great that I have been incessantly out with some one or
other of my friends who have been staying with me,
either riding or walking, which makes such inroads on
my time that I find I have much less leisure here for
reading and study than I have in London. Before I
came here I often saw Mr. Grenfell<a name="FNanchor_108_110" id="FNanchor_108_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_110" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>, who is very warm
on the subject of the Bank and the advantageous bargains
which it has always made with government, as well
for the management of the national debt, the composition
which it has hitherto paid for stamps, as for the compensation
which government has received in the way of loan
for enormous average deposits left with the Bank. I am
quite of his opinion, and indeed I go much further; I
think the Bank an unnecessary establishment, getting rich
by those profits which fairly belong to the public. I
cannot help considering the issuing of paper money as a
privilege which belongs exclusively to the State; I regard
it as a sort of seignorage, and I am convinced, if the
principles of currency were rightly understood, that commissioners
might be appointed, independent of all ministerial
control, who should be the sole issuers of paper
money,&mdash;by which I think a profit of from two to three
millions might be secured to the public, at the same time
that we should be protected from the abuses of the country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
banks, who are the cause of much mischief all over the
kingdom. These commissioners should also have the
management of the public debt, and should act as bankers
to all the different public departments. They might invest
the eleven millions which is the average of public
deposits in Exchequer Bills, a part of which might be sold
whenever occasion required. This of course (at least all
of it) could not be effected till the expiration of the Bank
Charter in 1833; but it is never too soon to give due
consideration to important principles, which might be
recognized, though not yet acted on. In looking over the
papers which have from time to time been laid before
Parliament, I think it might clearly be proved that the
profits of the bank have been enormous. I should think
they must have a hoard nearly equal to their capital. By
their charter they are bound to make an annual division
of their profits and to lay a statement of their accounts
before the proprietors; but they appear to set all law at
defiance. I always enjoy any attack upon the Bank, and
[if I] had sufficient courage I would be a party to it.</p>

<p>Though I have been thinking on this subject lately, I am
not less interested about our old subject, of the advantages
or disadvantages of high prices for raw produce. If I agreed
with Mr. Torrens that such high prices were accompanied
with a rise in the prices of commodities, and, if I thought
that such rise would not preclude the usual exchanges
with foreign countries, I should of course agree with you
that with such general high prices we should command a
greater quantity of foreign commodities in exchange for
a given quantity of ours; but I cannot admit in the first
place that commodities would rise because corn rose<a name="FNanchor_109_111" id="FNanchor_109_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_111" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>; and,
secondly, if they did so rise there are but very few which
we could sell in equal quantity at the advanced price to
foreigners; and, if we sold less to them, we could buy less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
of them, and thus would our general commerce suffer. I
can see great advantages attending low general prices but
none in high prices. On this subject we are not likely to
agree. I hope you are diligently employed and that early
in the year we shall see something new from your pen.
I have some curiosity to see a pamphlet just advertised<a name="FNanchor_110_112" id="FNanchor_110_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_112" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>,

<p>... Have you seen Monsieur Say's [Catec]hisme d'Economie
Politique? He has softened but not [expung]ed the
objectionable definitions.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Correspondence between Ricardo and J. B. Say is
given in the '&#338;uvres Diverses' of the latter, published after his
death (Guillaumin, 1848), with notes by Ch. Comte, Daire, and
Horace Say. J. B. Say (born 1767) was the son of a Lyons merchant,
of Huguenot origin. When a boy, he was sent with his brother
Horace to learn business in London, where he was struck, amongst
other things, by the fact that his Croydon landlord built up one of the
two windows of his lodgings to escape window tax. Having gained
familiarity with the English language and English ways he returned
to France in 1789 and entered the employment of a Life
Insurance Company, the manager of which (Clavi&egrave;re) lent him a
copy of the 'Wealth of Nations,' not yet translated into French.
The reading of it made him an economist for life, as it did
for Ricardo ten years later. After serving in the revolutionary
army in 1792, he left commerce for journalism. His chief book,
Le Trait&eacute; de l'Economie Politique, appeared in 1803. Too independent
to please Napoleon, he was forced to quit his new profession
for his old; and his commercial travelling landed him
eventually at Geneva, where he made the acquaintance of Necker,
Madame de Stael, and Benjamin Constant. He came back to
France (to Auchy, Pas de Calais) to spin cotton, retiring with a
moderate fortune in 1813. After the Peace he was sent by Government
to report on the economical condition of England.  He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
cordially received by Ricardo, Bentham, and other economists; and
on his return to Paris narrated with pride to his audiences at
the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers that the Glasgow professors
had made him sit in the chair of Adam Smith. After an active life
of teaching and writing, he died in Paris, 15th November, 1832.</p>

<p>Ricardo writes to him from Gatcomb Park on 18th Aug., 1815,
thanking him for the copy of the (first edition of the) 'Catechisme
de l'Economie Politique,' which he had just sent. Though complimenting
him highly on the work, he thinks that Say has not,
even yet, with sufficient clearness distinguished Value from Utility.
No doubt to have value a commodity must be <i>useful</i>, but it is the
<i>difficulty</i> of its production that is the sole measure of its value.
'The wealthiest man is he who has most values, and who is able,
by giving them in exchange, to procure himself not the things
which he himself and everybody else regard as the most desirable,
and which can be had at a low price, but the things that are
difficult to produce and consequently dear. A man is rich not by
the moderation of his desires, but by the quantity of commodities
that he possesses.' Say has also, in Ricardo's opinion, forgotten
sometimes that the growth of the capital of a manufacturer cannot
be safely estimated in money if we do not allow for the change in
the value of money. Ricardo concludes: 'The pleasure which
I take in reading and studying good works on political economy
has not diminished since I saw you. I should devote all my time
to the discussion of points which seem to me to need further
elucidation, if I had any talent for composition. However, I have
ventured to publish the pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_111_113" id="FNanchor_111_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_113" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> which I sent you, and I should
be glad to know your opinion on the doctrine which I maintain in
it in relation to the rent of land and the rate of profits, in opposition
to Mr. Malthus. I learn from Mr. Mill that several persons
in this country do not understand me because I have not explained
my views at sufficient length; and he is trying to induce me to
undertake an explanation of them from the beginning and at greater
length; but I fear that the undertaking is beyond my powers.'
(&#338;uvres Diverses de Say, pp. 409-11. Ricardo wrote in English,
but in this and the other cases the editors give only the French.)</p>

<p>Say's answer follows (pp. 411-13), 2nd Dec., 1815: 'Nous nous
occupons heureusement vous et moi de choses de tous les temps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
pl&ucirc;tot que de celles du moment actuel, qui ne sont pas gaies,
malgr&eacute; les f&ecirc;tes que l'on donne pour faire croire aux peuples qu'ils
sont heureux.' Going to the subject of value, he says he did <i>not</i>
say Utility was the measure of Value, but 'the value that men attach
to a thing is the measure of the utility they find in it;' moreover
he had not maintained the Stoical doctrine, 'the fewer wants, the
greater wealth,' but had simply said that a man is the richer if
all the things he wants (whatever they be) are cheap instead of
dear, and would be richest of all if he had abundance of everything
without any cost at all. He allows that Ricardo is right in regard
to the growth of the manufacturer's capital, and promises to introduce
the qualification suggested by Ricardo in his next edition.
In the controversy between Malthus and Ricardo he finds it difficult
to take a side, for he cannot for his part exclude from the
question of profits 'the talent and industrial capacity of the man
who brings out the resources of a land or a capital;' the profit
inherent merely in land or in capital seems to him unimportant
in comparison with the profit due to the source described. But
he says he is too timid to insist on his opinion, and will wait for
Ricardo's full explanations in the larger work. 'How I envy
your lot, to study political economy in your beautiful retreat of
Gatcomb Park! I shall never forget the too short moments I
passed there, nor the charms of your conversation.'</p></div>


<h3>XXXVI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="idt">By facility of production I do not mean to consider
the productiveness of the soil only, but the skill, machinery,
and labour joined to the natural fertility of the earth.
It does not therefore follow that because Otaheite<a name="FNanchor_112_114" id="FNanchor_112_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_114" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> has an
abundance of fertile land profits should be there at the
highest rate, because the skill and the means of abridging
labour may in Europe more than compensate this natural
advantage of Otaheite. The question is this: If part of
the skill and capital of England were employed in Otaheite
to produce 100,000 quarters of corn, would not the persons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
employing that capital obtain greater profits in Otaheite
than they would if they employed the same capital for the
same purpose here, and would not rent be lower there than
here? You must at any rate allow that the quantity of
corn produced with a given quantity of capital, supposing
the same skill to be employed, must be greater there than
here, or there is no meaning in fertility of soil. You must
allow too that in proportion to the fertility of Otaheite
and to its extent compared with the population will be
the lowness of rent, notwithstanding its abundant rate of
produce. I can easily <i>conceive</i> that, with the imperfect
tillage the people of Otaheite now give their land, the
population may be just sufficiently numerous to require
that the whole of their lands should be in cultivation, and
consequently that they should bear a rent; but let a
hundred Europeans only join them with our improved
machinery and perfectly skilled in husbandry, and the immediate
consequence would be that three quarters of their
lands would for a time become perfectly useless to them,
as the quarter might produce them more food than all the
inhabitants could possibly consume. Now I ask whether
it be possible that three quarters of the land of a country
can be suffered to pass from a state of tillage to a state of
nature without occasioning a fall in rents? If land is less
in demand, must not the rent of it fall? If you say no,
there is no truth in the proposition that value depends upon
the proportion between supply and demand. Now suppose
England in the state in which I have been fancying
Otaheite; and she is actually in that state, all or most of
her land being in cultivation; and suppose further that
there is another country totally unknown to us whose skill
and machinery in husbandry as far surpasses ours as ours
does that of the Otaheiteans. If a hundred of these persons
were to come amongst us with their capital, skill, etc.,
would not the same consequences follow as I have just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
stated? Now every improvement in machinery is precisely
on a small scale what I have been here supposing on
a large scale; and I am quite astonished that you should
yet maintain that 'universally where land is limited in
quantity, the facility of production upon it will go mainly
to rent, and the soil of a country might be of such fertility
as to yield sixtyfold instead of eight or ten, and yet the
profits of stock be only six per cent. and the wages of
labour both nominally and really low.' Land, like everything
else, rises or falls in proportion to the demand for
it; every improvement which shall enable you to raise the
same quantity of produce on a less quantity of land or,
which is the same thing, a larger quantity of produce on
the same quantity of land cannot increase the demand
for land and therefore cannot raise rents.</p>

<p>I do not clearly see the distinction which you think
important between productiveness of industry and productiveness
of capital. Every machine which abridges
labour adds to the productiveness of industry, but it adds
also to the productiveness of capital. England with
machinery and with a given capital will obtain a greater
real net produce than Otaheite with the same capital
without machinery, whether it be in manufactures or in
the produce of the soil. It will do so because it employs
much fewer hands to obtain the same produce. Industry
is more productive; so is capital. It appears to me that
one is a necessary consequence of the other, and that the
opinion which I have advanced and which you are combat[t]ing
is that in the progress of society independently
of all improvements in skill and machinery the produce of
industry constantly diminishes as far as the land is concerned,
and consequently capital becomes less productive.
That this diminution of produce is beneficial to all owners
of land, but that it is so at the expense of manufacturers,
amongst which [<i>sic</i>] I include farmers, first by rendering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the commodities which they manufacture of less exchangeable
value than they before were for corn, and secondly by
raising the cost of production by raising the price of labour.</p>

<p>I shall put this letter in the Post Office in London,
where I am going to-morrow for a few days. I have been
writing, in my unconnected and confused style, my opinions
on the profits of the Bank and on the advantages of a
paper and nothing but a paper currency. I am too little
pleased with it to think of publishing. The whole is too
little for a pamphlet. Mr. Grenfell is, I think, anxious
that something should be said about the Bank before the
meeting of Parliament, and I too wish some able hand
would undertake it.</p>

<p>I am always glad to hear that you are preparing for the
press; for, though I do not always agree in opinion with
you, I am sure that your writings will contribute towards
the progress of a science in which I take great interest.
I should be more pleased that we did not so materially
differ. If I am too theoretical (which I really believe is
is the case), you I think are too practical. There are so
many combinations and so many operating causes in
Political Economy that there is great danger in appealing
to experience in favour of a particular doctrine, unless we
are sure that all the causes of variation are seen and their
effects duly estimated. Mr. Whishaw and Mr. Warburton<a name="FNanchor_113_115" id="FNanchor_113_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_115" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
have been at Mr. Smith's for some time. I have been
absent from home unfortunately, and have seen but little
of them. I yesterday dined with Mr. Whishaw; he talked
of leaving Mr. Smith immediately....</p>

<p class="idt">I have an account before me of the capital actually
employed on a farm of 200 acres in Essex. It amounts to
&pound;3433 or about &pound;17 per acre<a name="FNanchor_114_116" id="FNanchor_114_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_116" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>, of which not more than
&pound;1100 or &pound;1200 is of that description which is not subject
to the same variation of value as the produce of the land
itself, for &pound;2200 consists of the value of the seeds in the
ground, the advances for labour, the horses and live
stock, etc. etc. If then the money value of the produce
from the land should fall <i>from facility of production</i> it
must ever continue to bear a greater ratio to the whole
money value of the capital employed on the land, for there
will be a great increase of average produce per acre, whilst
the fall in money value will be common to both capital
and produce, and it cannot therefore be true that rent,
profits, and wages can all <i>really</i> fall at the same time.</p>

<p>The effect of high or low wages on profits has always
been distinctly recognized by me:&mdash;till the population
increases to the proportion which the increased capital
can employ, wages will rise, and may absorb a larger
portion of the whole produce. But this effect will only
take place with an increase of capital, and has nothing to
do with new facilities of production. Wages do not
depend upon the quantity of a commodity which a day's
labour will produce, and I cannot help thinking you quite
incorrect when you say that the natural consequence of the
facility of production being so increased that a day's
labour will produce 4 measures of corn, cloth and cotton
instead of 2 measures, will be that 4 measures of corn,
cloth and cotton will be worth only the price of a day's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
labour instead of 2. It appears to me that, if, instead of
4, 10 measures could be produced by a day's labour, no
rise would take place in wages, no greater portion of corn,
cloth or cotton would be given to the labourer, unless a
portion of the increased produce were employed as capital,
and then the rise in wages would be in proportion to the
new demand for labour, and not at all in proportion to the
increase in the quantity of commodities produced. This
increase would be exclusively enjoyed by the owner of
stock, and, if he consumed in his family the whole increased
produce, without augmenting his capital, wages
would remain stationary, and not be in any way affected
by the increased facility of production.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with your proposition, namely, [']That
the means of employing capital profitably can never co-exist
with an abundant capital and produce and a stationary
population, on account of the necessary effect of such a
state of things in increasing the real price of labour,'
because I consider the rise of wages as by no means a
necessary effect of an abundant capital and produce, for
it may be accompanied with new facilities in procuring corn,
and then wages even if they should rise would not lessen
profits, they will only keep them lower than they otherwise
would be. In the case which we were considering
the other night, if every lady made her own shoes, a part
of the capital now employed in making shoes by the shoemakers
would be otherwise employed. The same labour
would be bestowed in the production of other objects
desirable to these lady shoemakers, who would have both
the power and the will to purchase them from the savings
which would accrue to them by employing their labour
productively. There is a great difference between [the]
common effects of an accumulation of capital, and the
employing the same capital more productively. The first
is generally attended with a rise of wages and a fall of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
profits for a time at least,&mdash;but the second may exist for
an indefinite length of time without producing any such
effects. In the case of great improvements in machinery,&mdash;capital
is liberated for other employments and at the same
time the labour necessary for those employments is also
liberated,&mdash;so that no demand for additional labour will
take place unless the increased production in consequence
of the improvement should lead to further accumulation
of capital, and then the effect on wages is
to be ascribed to the accumulation of capital and not
to the better employment of the same capital. If the
population were to be stopped whilst accumulation continued
the effects which you enumerate would undoubtedly
follow, but this would arise from the demand for labour
not being adequately supplied,&mdash;it would be the effect of
accumulation which would operate so powerfully that it
would be but slightly checked by the facility of production,
but it would not by any means be the consequence of
such facility.</p>

<p>It is true that the rate of profits depends upon the
scanty or abundant supply of capital compared with the
means of employing it profitably,&mdash;and these means will
as you say upon the common principles of supply and
demand be increased either by a diminution of capital or
by an extension of the market for it. Our inquiry is in
fact what the causes are of an extension of the market, and
I hold that the most powerful, and the only one which
operates permanently, is a reduction in the relative value
of food. You appear to me to concede a little respecting
demand being regulated by the power of production,&mdash;but
you are yet very far from yielding all that I demand. I
hope we shall meet this month, but I cannot yet say whether
I can leave London.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">Mrs. Ricardo and I are sorry that Mrs. Malthus will
be prevented from accompanying you when you pay us a
visit at Gatcomb. We should have been very happy to
have shown her some of the beauties of our county.
When you come, perhaps you will bring your gun with
you. Though I am no sportsman myself, I will endeavour
to procure you the best sport that my influence can
command.</p>

<p>I am very much obliged to you for the attention which
you have given to my MS.<a name="FNanchor_115_117" id="FNanchor_115_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_117" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> I am fully aware of the
deficiency in the style and arrangement; those are faults
which I shall never conquer. I will however use my best
endeavours to elevate it to the very low standard to
which you compare it<a name="FNanchor_116_118" id="FNanchor_116_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_118" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. It would be unpardonable to
write worse with more practice.</p>

<p>I expected that you would not quite agree with my plan
of abolishing the metals from circulation; but the grounds
on which you object to it may I think be answered, and
then your objections would I hope be removed. You fear
that without a metallic circulation we could not on an
emergency supply a large sum of bullion for the exigencies
of the State. The fact is however against you, for we
have supplied large sums when the metals have been
absolutely banished from circulation. This has been the
case during the whole Peninsular War. If indeed on my
system the Bank could keep a less quantity of bullion in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
their coffers to answer the demands of the public, the
objection would be well founded; but the only difference
would be that in one case their hoards would consist
wholly of coined gold and silver, and in the other they
would consist of the uncoined metals; but, on both
systems, if the Bank paid their notes on demand the
currency must be equally reduced in quantity, if gold and
silver should become more valuable. That argument then
may be used against a currency convertible at all, into
specie or bullion, but does not apply to one more than
the other. I think with you that on the whole silver
would be a better standard than gold, particularly if paper
only were used. All objections against its greater bulk
would be removed.</p>

<p>I find I did misapprehend your illustration respecting
profits from Otaheite; but our difference is still very
serious. I most distinctly allow that any causes which
tend to make capital less in demand will lower profits;
but I contend that there are no causes which will for any
length of time make capital less in demand, however
abundant it may become, but a comparatively high price
of food and labour,&mdash;that profits do not <i>necessarily</i> fall with
the increase of the quantity of capital, because the demand
for capital is infinite and [is] governed by the same law as
population itself. They are both checked by the rise in the
price of food and the consequent increase in the value of
labour. If there were no such rise, what could prevent population
and capital from increasing without limit? I acknowledge
the effects of the great principle of supply and demand
in every instance; but in this it appears to me that the
demand will enlarge at the same rate as the supply if there
be no difficulty on the score of food and raw produce.
Fertility is, as you justly observe, the essence of high rents;
and low rents are the necessary result of barrenness
however scarce corn may be. I agree with you too that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
in a country limited to 100,000 acres, all of the richest
conceivable quantity, yet peopled and capital'd up to the
utmost limits of its produce, the profits of stock and the
wages of labour would both be very low, although the
quantity of produce yielded by a given capital <i>including
rent</i> might be 100 per cent.; but I ask, if by any miracle
the produce of that land could at once be doubled, would
rents then continue as high as before, or could they
possibly rise? We are speaking of the immediate not the
ultimate effects. The improvements in skill and machinery
may in 1000 years go to the landlord, but for 900 they will
remain with the tenant.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">My letter was sent to the post before I received yours
of yesterday's date. The parcel you sent me has reached me
safe. I am sorry you had so much trouble about it.</p>

<p>My views respecting the Bank are entirely prospective.
The last return of bank notes in circulation was, I think,
larger than any that preceded it. I have not the paper in
London, but I think the circulation of bank notes then
amounted (1815) to 28,000,000 or more<a name="FNanchor_117_119" id="FNanchor_117_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_119" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.</p>

<p>It is dangerous to listen to reports respecting briskness
or slackness of trade. It is I believe certain that the revenue
has been uncommonly productive the last quarter, which is
no indication of diminished trade. As you allow that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
loss of the sellers is the gain of the buyers, you appear to
me to attribute effects much too great to the fall of raw
produce which has lately taken place. It does not follow
that, because prices are low, production will be discouraged.
If money were to fall very much in value whilst a country
was making great advances in prosperity, would not production
be encouraged, notwithstanding a fall of prices?</p>

<p>That profits may rise on the land, if population increases
faster than capital, I am not disposed to deny; but this will
be a partial rise of profits on a particular trade, for a limited
time, and is very different from a general rise of profits
on trade in general. This admission does not affect my
principle.</p>

<p class="idt">I write to remind you that the time is come at which
you once gave me hope almost to certainty that I should
have the pleasure of seeing you here; and even when I last
saw you you promised, if you could make it convenient, to
come and pass a part of your vacation with me. The weather
is beautiful, and my desire to see you as ardent as ever.
Come then and inhale the pure atmosphere of our hills, and
be under no fear that your visit will retard any object to
which your attention may now be devoted, for you shall be
free to write, study, or read, as many hours in the day as
you please, unmolested by any one's intrusion.</p>

<p>My lost MS.<a name="FNanchor_118_120" id="FNanchor_118_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_120" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> is recovered. Mr. Mill recommends its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
publication, but advises me to write an introduction, and
to divide it into sections. I had almost resolved to throw
it aside, but I have been again at work upon it, and, though
I cannot put it in any shape to please me, it is I think
rather better than when you saw it; and the probability at
present is that I shall venture to publish it.</p>

<p>I attended the Bank Court the other day. I had no intention
whatever of speaking; but some very bad reasoning
on the other side and a total deviation from the question
called me up, and I spoke for five or ten minutes with considerable
inward agitation, but without committing any
glaring blunder. My speaking is like my writing too
much compressed. I am too apt to crowd a great deal of
difficult matter into so short a space as to be incomprehensible
to the generality of readers. The Chronicle, I see, has
reported what he thought or heard I said, but he has imputed
to me what I neither felt nor uttered. Allusions
were made to the Bullion question, and it was said that
it had been prophesied that, if the Bank directors were
corrupt, they might with the power they had of issuing
paper occasion the greatest public distress; no such distress,
however, had been experienced. I observed in reply that
the goodness of the system was not proved by the distress not
having occurred,&mdash;that the speaker had been only paying
a compliment to the integrity of the directors, in which no
one in the court was more ready to join than myself,&mdash;but,
if the directors had been corrupt, I still thought that they
had been armed with the power of doing mischief. Though
I was ready to declare my confidence in the integrity of the
directors, there were many parts of their system of which
I could not approve, etc. etc. This is very different from
the report in the Chronicle; but I understand that the reporters
were most carefully excluded from the court.</p>

<p>I hope the business at the college has been settled to
your satisfaction, and that the result of the late unpleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
disturbance<a name="FNanchor_119_121" id="FNanchor_119_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_121" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> will give you some security against its recurrence
in future.</p>

next engage your attention? For I hope, as M. Say says,
that you will 'travaillez toujours' [<i>sic</i>]....</p>

<p>[I began] by assuring you that I was not going to weary
you with a repetition of my hundred times told tale, and
I am ashamed to see that I have filled four sides with
nothing else. There are some other points on which I shall
make some remarks when I have the pleasure of seeing
you. If you should come to town, will you do me the
favour to call at the Stock Exchange, unless my house
should not be much out of your way. I recommend your
calling there because I am just about deserting Brook Street
for some time. Mrs. Ricardo and all the family are going
to Ramsgate to-morrow morning, and she will not consent
to let me remain at home by myself, so that when I am in
London I shall be chiefly with my brother at Bow; now
and then I shall pass a night at home. My business is so
uncertain that I cannot at all foresee what portion of the
next two or three months I shall be able to spend at the
sea side. It is probable that I shall be so much in town
that I shall be found by you at the Stock Exchange....</p>

<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">Your two letters have both reached me, and I am
very sorry to find that I shall not have the pleasure of seeing
you at Gatcomb this vacation. I left London, as you supposed,
the day after the Bank Court. I should have considered
it fortunate if whilst I was there I had met you.
My house in Brook Street is not yet in a state to receive
us; nor will it be this season, unless we consent to go in
it with the walls unpapered and unpainted, conditions to
which we shall agree. It will be we are told in a habitable
state by the latter end of the month, at which time we shall
probably quit Gatcomb.</p>

<p>As you have not given me the pleasure of your company
here, and as I wish to speak to Murray concerning my book
and to consult some Parliamentary papers which I have
not got here, I intend taking a trip to town the beginning
of next week. Do you think I shall have any chance of
meeting you there? Remember that a letter will always
find me at or follow me from the Stock Exchange<a name="FNanchor_121_123" id="FNanchor_121_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_123" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly provoking that you should have been
so much interrupted by college affairs as not to have made
more progress with your new chapters. I shall regret your
thinking it necessary to abridge or leave out anything
which you may have to say connected with the subject,
and particularly if you should so determine, because more
time will otherwise be required before you can publish.
The question of bounties and restrictions is exceedingly important,
and, unless you have already given your present
opinions on that subject elsewhere, or mean to do so, it
ought to form part of the present work<a name="FNanchor_122_124" id="FNanchor_122_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_124" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>; and a little delay
in the publication is not very important.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>The edition which I have of your work is the first, and it
is many years since I read it. When you wrote to me that
you were looking over the chapters on the Agricultural and
Manufacturing systems with a view to make some alterations
in them, I looked into those chapters and saw a great
deal in them which differed from the opinions I have formed
on that part of the subject. At your house I observed that
in a subsequent edition you had altered some of the passages
to which I particularly objected, and in the chapters as you
are now writing them it appeared to me that there was
only a slight trace of the difference we have often discussed.
The general impression which I retain of the book is excellent.
The doctrines appeared so clear and so satisfactorily
laid down that they excited an interest in me inferior only
to that produced by Adam Smith's celebrated work<a name="FNanchor_123_125" id="FNanchor_123_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_125" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>. I remember
mentioning to you, and I believe you told me that
you had altered it in the following editions, that I thought
you argued in some places as if the poor rates had no effect
in increasing the quantity of food to be distributed,&mdash;that
I thought you were bound to admit that the poor laws
would increase the demand and consequently the supply.
This admission does not weaken the grand point to be
proved.</p>

<p>As for the difference between us on Profits, of which you
speak in your letter, you have not, I think, stated it correctly.
You say that my opinion is 'that general profits
never fall from a general fall of prices compared with
labour, but from a general rise of labour compared with
prices.' I will not acknowledge this to be my proposition.
I think that corn and labour are the variable commodities,
and that other things neither rise nor fall but from difficulty
or facility of production or from some cause particularly
affecting the value of money, and that no alteration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of price proceeding from these causes affect[s] general
profits,&mdash;allowing always some effect for cheapness of the
raw material....</p>

<p class="idt">I arrived in town yesterday and found your letter
at the Stock Exchange. It is very uncertain whether
I shall leave London to-morrow evening or Monday evening.
I am desirous of getting home on many accounts, but
I may not be able to accomplish the business for which
I came so soon as I expected, and, if I do not get it done
by to-morrow it will in all probability detain me till
Monday. Thus then it is still uncertain whether we are
to meet, and I do not exactly know how to make you
acquainted with my movements. I will, however, let Mr.
Murray know if I leave town to-morrow, and, if you are in
the neighbourhood of Russell Square, by sending to No. 8,
Montague Street (Mr. Basevi's), you will be sure to know.
In the City, at the Stock Exchange, any of my brothers
will inform you about me. If I should not be gone, will
you do me the favour of dining with me on Friday at Mr.
Basevi's? His dinner hour is six o'clock, and he begs me
to say that he shall be much flattered by your favouring
him with your company. I was in hopes of finding you in
London and of having the benefit of your opinion of my
book<a name="FNanchor_124_126" id="FNanchor_124_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_126" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> in its present state, before I sent it to be printed.
That advantage I must now forego, because I am desirous of
getting it out before the meeting of Parliament, and have
before experienced the inconvenience of too much hurry.</p>

<p>I cannot think it inconsistent to suppose that the money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
price of labour may rise when it is necessary to cultivate
poorer land, whilst the real price may at the same time fall.
Two opposite causes are influencing the price of labour, one
the enhanced price of some of the things on which wages
are expended, the other the fewer enjoyments which the
labourer will have the power to command. You think
these may balance each other, or rather that the latter
will prevail; I on the contrary think the former the most
powerful in its effects. I must write a book to convince you.</p>

<p>I am glad you are not going to cut your next edition
short.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The MS. referred to in this letter was probably the
pamphlet on 'Economical and Secure Currency,' which internal
evidence would show to have been printed not earlier than Feb.,
1816. Ricardo, as appears from Letter XL, had already submitted
the MS. to James Mill. In the fragment of a letter to Mill
(quoted in Bain's 'Life of Mill,' p. 153, and dated Jan., 1816) he
writes: 'Fill eight pages in the Appendix, will that be too much?'
Professor Bain thinks this must refer to the 'Principles of Political
Economy and Taxation' (1817). But that work has no Appendix;
and there seems no reason why it should not refer to the 'Economical
and Secure Currency' (1816), which has one. The 'Resolutions
proposed concerning the Bank of England by Mr. Grenfell,'
and those proposed by Mr. Mellish, together, cover seven pages of
that Appendix in the original edition; and Ricardo in the fragment
quoted had probably been saying, that these Resolutions, if
he printed them, would fill nearly eight pages, etc.</p></div>

<p class="idt">I arrived in town yesterday, with the whole of my
numerous family. We are already as comfortably settled in
Brook Street as under all circumstances we can expect, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
I hasten to inform you that we have a bed ready for you,
which I hope you will very soon occupy. I have forgotten
on which Saturday in the month you meet at the King of
Clubs, but conclude from your last meeting that it is the
second. If so, you will probably be in town to-morrow or
Friday, when I shall hope that you will lodge at our house
and give us as much of your company as your numerous
friends will allow you to do.</p>

<p>You have probably ere this seen my book<a name="FNanchor_125_127" id="FNanchor_125_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_127" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. I have been
reading it in its present dress, and very much lament that
I make no progress in the very difficult art of composition.
I believe that ought to be my study before I intrude any
more of my crude notions on the public.</p>

<p>It is said that the Bank have made some agreement with
Government, but what it is is not exactly known. They
talk of the Bank advancing to Government six millions at
four per cent., besides continuing the loan of three millions
without interest. We shall not, however, be long in suspense
on this subject, as a general court of proprietors is to
be held to-morrow, when the directors will make some
communication to the proprietors to ask for their vote to
sanction their agreement. They will ask for this without
giving them any information either respecting their savings,
their profits, or the amount of public deposits. Is not this
a ridiculous piece of mockery, and an insult to our common
sense? I hope there may be a few independent proprietors
present who may call for information, or who may at least
demand a ballot, for which purpose nine only are necessary<a name="FNanchor_126_128" id="FNanchor_126_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_128" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>.
You would be surprised at the abjectness of the city men,
and the great influence which the directors have in consequence
of their power of discounting bills. I am persuaded

value, I should have gained half the battle....</p>

<p class="idt">I beg to remind you that the first Saturday in the
next month is to-morrow se'n-night, on which day or a few
days before it, I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you in
Brook Street. We have a bed always at your service, and
I wish you would make the rule invariable to take up your
lodging with us whenever you visit London.</p>

<p>I hope you have quite determined to extend your new
edition to another volume, and that you are now making
great progress in it. I wish much to see a regular and connected
statement of your opinions on what I deem the
most difficult and perhaps the most important topic of
political economy, namely, the progress of a country in
wealth, and the laws by which the increasing produce is
distributed.</p>

<p>Have you seen Torrens' Letter to Lord Liverpool<a name="FNanchor_127_129" id="FNanchor_127_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_129" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>? He
appears to me to have adopted all my views respecting
profits and rent; and, in some conversation which I had
with him a few days ago, he unequivocally avowed that he
was now of my opinion, that the price of labour, arising
from a difficulty in procuring food, did not affect the prices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
of commodities. He confessed that his former view on that
subject was erroneous. I should be glad to see all the
arguments in favour of my view of the question clearly
and ably stated. I should not wonder if Torrens undertook
it.</p>

<p>The sale of my last pamphlet has far exceeded its merits.
Murray is printing a second edition<a name="FNanchor_128_130" id="FNanchor_128_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_130" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. I had no idea that
the subject was of much interest to the public, but it seems
that they are curious about the amount of the Bank
treasure. In the House of Commons the defence of the
contracts with the Bank was very little satisfactory; they
endeavoured to fix the attention of the House on what the
public had got and saved by the operations of the Bank;
they seemed to think that all the rest belonged of right to
the Bank.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Torrens came nearest to fulfilment of the above forecast
in his 'Essay on the Production of Wealth' (1821), which was
announced as 'a general treatise upon Political Economy, combining
with the principles of Adam Smith so much of the more recent
doctrines as may be conformable to truth and embodying the
whole into one consentaneous system.' (Pref. p. v.) But he
thinks out the subject vigorously for himself; and, though in
all his later books he extols Ricardo above all his contemporaries,
he finds frequent occasion to differ from him. Indeed he occasionally
claims that Ricardo is the borrower, and he the lender.
Ricardo, for example, is indebted to him (he says) for the doctrine
that, when a nation has great advantage in one production but a
much greater advantage in another, it will confine itself to producing
the latter, and will even import the former (Ricardo, Works,
pp. 76, 77; cf. Torrens, Preface to Essay on External Corn Trade,
p. vii).  Yet the doctrine has always passed as Ricardian <i>par<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
excellence</i> (see e.g. Cairnes, Leading Principles of Political Economy,
Part III. ch. i. p. 371, and Logical Method, p. 81), and we
should not guess, from Letter XLVII for example, that Ricardo
was the convert. The Preface to the 'Production of Wealth' ends
with the prediction that in twenty years' time there would be unanimity
amongst Economists on all fundamental principles.</p></div>

<p class="idt">The public papers have ere this informed you of the
result of yesterday's ballot at the India House; Mr. Jackson's
motion was lost by a majority of twenty-one or
twenty-two. Mr. Jackson, in his reply, said everything of
you that your most partial friends could wish; and indeed
the general tone of his speech, yesterday, was much more
moderate than that by which he introduced his motion.
Mr. Bosanquet's<a name="FNanchor_130_132" id="FNanchor_130_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_132" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> comments on some passages in your
pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_131_133" id="FNanchor_131_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_133" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> lead me to think that he must have misunderstood
you, as I conceive that it was not your intention by
recommending the directors to appoint more young men than
there were vacant writerships, that the unsuccessful candidates
should be finally and irrecoverably dismissed from all
chance of going out to India<a name="FNanchor_132_134" id="FNanchor_132_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_134" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>. I imagine that it was your
intention to let them be again competitors for one of the
prizes of the following year, and therefore that the punishment
of their neglect would rather be a delay in their
appointment than an absolute dismission. Mr. Bosanquet
appeared to me to argue on the latter supposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Elphinstone<a name="FNanchor_133_135" id="FNanchor_133_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_135" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> spoke very kindly and very handsomely
of the professors; yet I thought that he was by far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the most formidable opponent of the College as at present
constituted, and the one that I should have been least
able to answer. His speech was short, but from the
moderation of his language it produced, I think, a considerable
effect, and gave great courage to Mr. Jackson's party.
I hope this subject will not be again revived, or, rather,
I hope that the proficiency of the young men, and the
absence of all turbulence, will satisfy every one of the
impolicy of interfering with the establishment.</p>

<p>I am sorry to be under the necessity of putting off my

Saturday<a name="FNanchor_134_136" id="FNanchor_134_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_136" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>.... We are going ... into Gloucestershire, so that
I must defer my visit to you to some more favourable
opportunity. Perhaps you may be in London to the King

my observations<a name="FNanchor_135_137" id="FNanchor_135_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_137" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> on your pamphlets before they go to

you will not be in so great a hurry to get home as you
usually are. On the Monday, after your club meeting, I
shall ask a few of your and my friends to meet you at
dinner, and on Sunday or any other day perhaps Warburton
and Mill will take a family meal with us. I have just received
an invitation from Mr. Blake to dine with him on
Friday the 3rd May, and I have taken upon myself to let
you know from him that he hopes you will favour him
with your company on that day. You will I trust be also
agreeable to this arrangement.</p>

<p>I hope you have made better use of your time than I

with the different works which you have in hand.
I have done nothing since I saw you as I have been obliged
to go very often into the city, and after leaving off for a
day or two I have the greatest disinclination to commence
work again. I may continue to amuse myself with my
speculations, but I do not think I shall ever proceed further.
Obstacles almost invincible oppose themselves to
my progress, and I find the greatest difficulty to avoid confusion
in the most simple of my statements.</p>

<p>Have you seen Torrens' letters to the Earl of Lauderdale
in the 'Sun?' I think he has published five. They are
chiefly on the subject of currency, and are ingenious, though
I think they support some very incorrect doctrines. They
are signed with his name.</p>

<p>Horner, I understand, will oppose the continuance of the
restriction bill; he does not deny now the fall in the value
of gold and silver since the termination of the war. There
cannot be a better opportunity than the present for the
Bank to recommence payments in specie. Silver is actually
under the mint price. The change is surprising [and
has been] brought about in a very unexpected [manner]....</p>

<p class="idt">From what you said when you left London it is
probable that you will not be at the Club on Saturday
next. If your visit to town should be deferred till the
following Tuesday we have a bed at your service&mdash;it is
now occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Smith, our Gloucestershire
friends. In case you should come sooner I hope you will
be able to pass much of your time with us. Our breakfast
hour is now at so reasonable a time that I hope you will
take that meal with us the first morning you are in
London, and then settle how often we shall see you at

<p>I suppose you have been too busy in official occupations,
since we last met, to have made much progress in the writings
which you have in hand. I hope, however, that you
will be prepared to give the public the result of your well
considered opinions in due season. We have a right to

with which Political Economy is encumbered<a name="FNanchor_137_139" id="FNanchor_137_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_139" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<p>Major Torrens tells me that he shall work hard for the
next few months, so that we may expect a book on the
same subject from him next year. He continues to hold
some heretical opinions on money and exchange, notwithstanding
Mr. Mill and I have exerted all our eloquence to
bring him to the right faith. We, however, have succeeded
in removing some of the obscurity which clouds his vision
on the principles of exchange. He is, I think, quite a convert
to <i>all</i> what you have called my peculiar opinions on profits,
rent, etc. etc., so that I may fairly say that I hold no principles
on Political Economy which have not the sanction
either of your or his authority, which renders it much less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
important that I should persevere in the task which I commenced
of giving my opinions to the public. Those principles
will be much more ably supported either by you or
by him than I could attempt to support them. My labours
have wholly ceased for two months; whether in the quiet
and calm of the country I shall again resume them is very
doubtful. My vanity has not received sufficient stimulus
to remove the temptation which is constantly offering itself
to the indulgence of my idle habits.</p>

<p class="idt">I am obliged to you for the interest you have taken
about my boat.... I am glad that Mrs. Malthus and Miss
Eckersall were pleased with their excursion to Easton Grey
and Gatcomb. They and you would have better satisfied
me that your visit was agreeable if you had not been in so
great a hurry to put an end to it. Our friends at Easton
Grey have been staying a few days with us, accompanied
by Mr. Binda. We expected Mr. Warburton to join them
here, but he wrote to delay his journey for a couple of
days.... He appears pleased with the idea of his journey
to Italy, though Mrs. Austin, who is returned, did not fail
to represent in the strongest colours the disagreeables
which she encountered. He I daresay is a very good traveller,
and my daughter I have always thought the very
worst I ever met with.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>The Smiths leave Easton Grey on Monday for London.
I suppose you have heard that they are going with Mr.
Whishaw to the Netherlands and Holland. They will I
am sure be very much delighted with their excursion.
They always go a journey, as indeed I think they travel
through life, with a disposition to be pleased. They view
everything through a favourable medium, and are not eager
to spy out the defects of every object they encounter.</p>

<p>I have no difficulty in agreeing with you 'that the rate
of profits of stock depends mainly on the demand and
supply of stock compared with the demand and supply of
labour,' if by those words you mean the rise or fall of wages.
That is my identical proposition. Now, if labour rises, no
matter from what cause, profits will fall; but there are two
causes which raise the wages of labour,&mdash;one the demand
for labourers being great in proportion to the supply,&mdash;the
other that the food and necessaries of the labourer are difficult
of production or require a great deal of labour to produce
them. The more I reflect on the subject the more I
am convinced that the latter cause has an incessant operation.
It is very seldom that the whole additional produce
obtained with the same quantity of labour falls to the lot
of the labourers who produce it; but, if it should, I should
yet contend that the rate of profits would fall because the
price of corn would fall with such an increased facility of
production; capital would be withdrawn from the land,
rents would fall, and profits rise. The causes you mention
may operate in Poland and America; I have never denied
it. The proportion between labour and capital will undoubtedly
affect profits, because it will affect wages; but
it is not the only element in the consideration of the subject
of profits; there are other causes which also affect wages.
Whether that demand can be general which increases price
must, I apprehend, depend on whether the precious metals
can be furnished as rapidly as other commodities.  If the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
savings or acquisitions of labour are exchanged for all
commodities in the same proportion, and the demand
should increase in that proportion also, I can see no
reason why any commodity should rise; but, if the demand
for cloth or gold be either greater or less than the
supply, they may rise or fall in their exchangeable value.
That is to say, their market value might rise or fall; but
their natural value would probably undergo little variation,
and therefore after a time they would exchange at their
usual rates. A new value thrown in the market always
supposes a certain quantity of sales as well as purchases;
if no part of that value consists of the precious metals, I do
not see how all commodities could rise. I should expect
some to rise and some to fall, but the general tendency
would rather be to the latter.</p>

profits, and wages, and in what manner they are affected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
by the increasing difficulty of procuring food, by the increase
of capital, and the improvement of machinery. I
fear we shall not agree on these subjects, and I should be
very glad if we could fairly submit our different views to
the public, that we might have some able heads engaged in
considering it [<i>sic</i>]<a name="FNanchor_139_141" id="FNanchor_139_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_141" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. Of this, however, I have little hope,
for though I feel strongly the truth of my theory I cannot
succeed in stating it clearly. I have been very much impeded
by the question of price and value, my former ideas
on those points not being correct. My present view may
be equally faulty, for it leads to conclusions at variance
with all my preconceived opinions. I shall continue to
work, if only for my own satisfaction, till I have given my
theory a consistent form.</p>

<p>You say that you think I have sometimes conceded that
if population were miraculously stopped, while the most
fertile land remained uncultivated, profits would fall upon
the supposition of an increase of capital still going on. I
concede it now. Profits I think depend on wages,&mdash;wages
depend on demand and supply of labour, and on the cost of
the necessaries on which wages are expended. These two
causes may be operating on profits at the same time, either
in the same, or in an opposite direction. In the case you
put wages would have a tendency to keep stationary as far
as the supply of food was concerned, but they would have
a tendency to rise in consequence of the demand for labour
increasing, whilst the supply continued the same. Under
such circumstances profits would of course fall. You must,
however, allow that this is an extraordinary case, and out
of the common course of events, for the tendency of the
population to increase is, in our state of society, more than
equal to that of the capital to increase. I shall be in Lon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>don
on Thursday or Friday next.... I should be glad if
some fortunate accident were to take you to town at the
same time. If so let me know where you are to be found;
a line directed to the Stock Exchange will be certain to

or February. I wish you would come and see a little more

<p class="idt">I arrived in London this morning and found your
kind letter, which I ought to have answered immediately,
as you could not otherwise know whether I accepted your
kind invitation, before the time that you might expect me.
The truth is I forgot the day of the week, and was not
aware till I got home that we were so near Saturday. I
very much regret that I shall not be able to avail myself
of Mrs. Malthus' and your kindness, as I have engagements
here which will prevent me from leaving town till I return
to Gatcomb.</p>

<p>You mistake me if you suppose me to say that under no
circumstances of facility of production profits could fall.
What I say is that profits will rise when wages fall, and,
as one of the main causes of the fall of wages is cheap food
and necessaries, it is <i>probable</i> that with facility of production,
or cheap food and necessaries, profits would rise. At
the very time that the labour of a certain number of men
may produce on such land as pays no rent 1100 instead of
1000 quarters of corn, and when corn falls in consequence
from &pound;5 to &pound;4 10<i>s.</i> per quarter, the money as well as the
corn wages of labour <i>may</i> rise, for capital <i>may</i> have in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>creased
at a very rapid rate, and labourers at a slow rate,
in which case profits would fall and not rise. Under these
very peculiar circumstances of higher money wages with a
lower price of necessaries, the wages of labour would be in
an unusual state, and would shortly revert to the old standard,
when profits would feel the benefit. All I mean to
contend for is that profits depend on wages, wages under
common circumstances on the price of food and necessaries,
and the price of food and necessaries on the fertility of the
last cultivated land. In all cases it is perhaps true that
rent will depend upon the demand compared with the
supply of good land, and wages on the demand compared
with the supply of labour, if it be allowed that the price of
necessaries influence[s] the demand and supply of labour.</p>

<p>I do not quite understand the expression that profits
depend on the demand compared with the supply of capital.
What would you say of two countries in [which] there
are precisely equal capitals, where wages [are] also equal,
and where the population is precisely in the same number.
Would the demand compared with the supply of capital be
the same in both? If you say they would, I ask whether
their rate of profits would be the same under any other
supposition but that of their land being exactly of the
same degree of fertility? To me it appears quite probable
that the ordinary and usual rate of profits might in one
be 20 and in the other only 15 per cent., or in any other
proportions....</p>

<p class="idt">My stay in London will not be prolonged beyond
Friday next. I hope it will be convenient to you to come up
before. On Thursday I shall be disengaged and will meet
you at any place in London that may best suit you, unless
you will dine with me at my brother's at Bow. His house

<p>The money wages of labour are, I apprehend, generally
regulated by facility of production. With an abundant production
too I think that a less proportion of the whole will be
given to the landlords, and more will remain for the other
two classes, of capitalists and labourers; but of this increased
quantity a greater proportion will be given to capitalists
and a less proportion to labourers. Now, though what you
call the real wages of labour<a name="FNanchor_140_142" id="FNanchor_140_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_142" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> (but which I think a wrong
term) will increase, the money wages will fall. But this
will not be the case with profits; what you would call real
profits would increase, but so would also money profits.
Under the circumstances then that I have supposed, the
rate of profits would rise though money wages would fall.
The difference between us is this. I say that with every
facility or difficulty of production, of the quantity of necessaries,
that is to be divided between profits and wages,
different proportions will be given to each, and that money
will accurately show those proportions. You appear to me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
to think that profits do not depend on the division of the
produce, and that money wages may as often rise with
facility of production as fall.</p>

<p>You state the real question fairly; it is, 'What is the
main cause which determines the rate of profits under all
the varying degrees of productiveness?' You do not appear
to me [to] solve the question when you answer 'that
it is the proportion which capital bears to labour.' In a
rich country where profits are low, and where a great portion
of produce is paid to the landlords for rent, the proportion
of labour to capital will be the greatest, and yet
according to your theory it should be the least. You will
not, I think, deny that in a country where labour is high a
manufacturer would employ more capital to produce the
same commodities than what he would do in a country
where wages were low, and there also would profits be low;
that is to say, profits are high where capital bears a large
proportion to labour, and low where labour bears a large
proportion to capital.</p>

<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">A long time has elapsed since I had the pleasure of
seeing you, during which time I have often intended writing,
as I did not hear from you; but my natural indolence
prevailed, and I have procrastinated it till now. I had
some faint hopes that you might be in the neighbouring
county this vacation, in which case I should have hoped to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
prevail on you to pass a short time here; but I learnt from
Mr. Binda, who is on a visit to Mr. Smith, that he had met
with you at Holland House, and that it was not probable
you would go far from home. I had previously enquired
about you of our young neighbour George Clerk; he, however,
could only tell me you were well; he knew nothing
about your intended movements.</p>

<p>By an advertisement in the public papers I perceive that
you have been occupied in writing about your College<a name="FNanchor_141_143" id="FNanchor_141_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_143" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>,
which I regret, as I believe the task was not very agreeable
to you, and as it may have prevented you from proceeding
with other works in which I imagine you are more
interested. I should be glad to hear that everything you
think defective in the College was remedied, and that it
was placed on such a footing as to require only the ordinary
routine of your attention.</p>

<p>I have been occasionally employed, since we met, in putting
my thoughts on paper, on the subjects which have often
passed under our discussion. I have encountered the usual
obstacles from difficulties of composition; but I have resolutely
persevered till I have committed everything to paper
that was floating in my mind. There are a few points on
which there is a shadow of difference between my present
and my past opinions; but they are not those on which we
could not agree. I hope I shall succeed in putting my MS.
in some tolerable order, as on that will depend whether I
shall again appear before the public. What I have hitherto
done is rather a statement of my own opinions than an
attempt at the refutation of the opinions of others. Lately,
however, I have been looking over Adam Smith, Say, and
Buchanan, and where I have seen passages in their works
contrary to the principles I hold to be correct I have noticed
them, and shall perhaps make them the subject of
some comment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>I fear I shall not have the satisfaction of receiving your
acquiescence to my doctrines, particularly as I have reverted
to my former views respecting taxes on raw produce.
Whatever may be correct on that subject, surely
Adam Smith is wrong, as there are various passages in his
book inconsistent with each other.</p>

<p>We shall, I hope, soon meet and renew our discussions
on some of these difficult matters. I shall be in London on
Friday next, and hope to see you in Brook Street as our
inmate, as soon after that day as business or inclination
may draw you to London.</p>

<p>I want to hear your opinion of the measures lately
adopted for the relief of the poor<a name="FNanchor_142_144" id="FNanchor_142_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_144" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>. I am not one of those
who think that the raising of funds for the purpose of employing
the poor is a very efficacious mode of relief, as it
diverts those funds from other employments which would
be equally if not more productive to the community. That
part of the capital which employs the poor on the roads,
for example, cannot fail to employ men somewhere, and I
believe every interference is prejudicial....</p>

<p class="ralign1">
<span class="smcap">Upper Brook Street, London</span>, <i>24 Jan., 1817</i>.</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">I have read your pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_143_145" id="FNanchor_143_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_145" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> with great pleasure,
and am very much satisfied with your arguments in favour
of a college in preference to a school for the education of
the young men destined to manage the complicated affairs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of our Indian Empire. The testimonies from India in
favour of the young men sent from the College, as compared
with those who went out to India before the establishment
of the College make powerfully for you, and do not appear
to have been answered by your opponents. I observe by
the papers that the discussion on this subject will be renewed
at the India House on the 6th February, at which
time I conclude that you will be in London. If so, I hope
you will make my house your headquarters. Mr. Murray
promised to send copies of your book to the gentlemen you
directed me to mention to him.</p>

<p>It appears to me that one great cause of our difference
in opinion on the subjects which we have so often discussed
is that you have always in your mind the immediate and
temporary effects of particular changes, whereas I put these
immediate and temporary effects quite aside, and fix my
whole attention on the permanent state of things which
will result from them. Perhaps you estimate these temporary
effects too highly, whilst I am too much disposed to
undervalue them. To manage the subject quite right,
they should be carefully distinguished and mentioned, and
the due effects ascribed to each.</p>

<p>I have been reading again your three last pamphlets
on rent and corn, and cannot help thinking there is
some ambiguity in the language. The word [<i>sic</i>], 'high
price of raw produce,' is calculated to produce a different
impression on your reader from what you mean. Your
first and third causes of high price appear to me to be
directly at variance with each other. The first is the
fertility of land, the third the scarcity of fertile land.
The second cause too, I think, never operates<a name="FNanchor_144_146" id="FNanchor_144_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_146" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>. There is
one passage in particular which expresses fully my opinions.
I have not the book by me, and cannot refer you to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
page, but it begins, 'I have no hesitation in stating that independently
of irregularities in the currency,' etc. It is in
the essay on Rent<a name="FNanchor_145_147" id="FNanchor_145_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_147" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.</p>

<p>Surely Buchanan is right and your comment<a name="FNanchor_146_148" id="FNanchor_146_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_148" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> wrong;
rent is not a creation but a transfer of wealth. It is the
necessary consequence of rent being the effect and not the
cause of high price<a name="FNanchor_147_149" id="FNanchor_147_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_149" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>.</p>

<p>Say and I would say that by turning revenue into capital
we shall obtain both an increased supply and an increased
demand; but, if the same capital be so created, I do not
approve of its present application, and taking it out of the
hands of those who know best how to employ it, to encourage
industry of a different kind and under the superintendence
of those who know nothing of the wants and demands
of mankind, and blindly produce cloth or stockings of which
we have already too much, or improve roads which nobody
wishes to travel....</p>

<p class="idt">I am not in the least acquainted with the subject on
which your papers<a name="FNanchor_148_150" id="FNanchor_148_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_150" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> treat, but that is no reason why I should
not mention what appears to me defective. In page 8<a name="FNanchor_149_151" id="FNanchor_149_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_151" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> you
add 1/6 to the births for probable omissions, and 1/12 for deaths;
but you do not tell your reader why these proportions are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
taken rather than 1/4 or 1/3, nor can I discover on what
grounds those numbers are chosen.</p>

<p>You sometimes take averages from the known facts of
certain years; but your averages are formed on an arithmetical
ratio while your application is to a geometrical
series. I submit whether this is correct.</p>

<p>If, as you say in page 14<a name="FNanchor_150_152" id="FNanchor_150_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_152" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>, births are to burials as 47
to 30, and the mortality as 1 to 47, the addition to the population
would be little more than 1/82 instead of 1/83, for out of
every 1410 persons 30 would die and 47 would be born, and
consequently there would be an increase of 17; but 1410
divided by 17 is 82.94, or 83 nearly; and therefore, if 1410
gives an increase of 17, 9,287,000 will give an increase of
111,970, or 1,119,700 in ten years, which will raise the
population 9,287,000 + 1,119,700 = 10,406,700 instead of
10,483,000<a name="FNanchor_151_153" id="FNanchor_151_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_153" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>.</p>

<p>In page 16<a name="FNanchor_152_154" id="FNanchor_152_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_154" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> the mortality is supposed to be as before,
1 in 47, and the births to the population as 1 to 29&frac12;, and
the population to be 9,287,000. This latter sum divided by
29&frac12; gives 314,813 the annual number of births, and divided
by 47 gives 197,595 the annual number of deaths; deduct
one from the other (197,595 from 314,813) gives 117,218 for
the annual increase, which in ten years would be 1,172,180,
which added to the former population of 9,287,000 gives
10,459,180 instead of 10,531,000.</p>

<p>I have marked in pages 35 and 36 some very trifling
errors. These are all I can discover with the facts which
are before me.</p>

<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>21 Feb., 1817</i>.</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">I am very sorry that you were prevented from being in
London yesterday. I fully expected to see you, as I thought
the subject of debate at the India House was of too much
interest not to make you desirous of hearing it.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant<a name="FNanchor_153_155" id="FNanchor_153_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_155" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> was, I assure you, a warm advocate in the
cause of the College. He spake admirably and with great
effect, improving in energy and eloquence as he proceeded.
He did justice to the various qualifications of the professors
for the responsible situations which they filled, and I believe
left nothing unsaid which might assist the cause which he
so ably defended. I thought him very severe on Randle
Jackson, who will find it difficult to answer some parts of
his speech. In the Times the report of what he said is very
correct, as far as it goes; but it is necessarily a very abbreviated
statement. Mr. Kinnaird<a name="FNanchor_154_156" id="FNanchor_154_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_156" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> began by speaking in
the most respectful manner of you, and indeed in terms of
great eulogy, but afterwards I think absurdly dwelt on
your being an interested party and an advocate for the
college, and imitated Mr. Jackson in his irony on those
whom he first declared were highly deserving of respect.
In what manner could we have any correct account of the
college and its concerns but from an interested party? Who
could speak of its management, attainments, and discipline,
but those who were acquainted with it? He, however, gave
up the only strong grounds they had (if they had been true)
for inquiring into the affairs of the college, for he said that he
had no idea that there was more immorality and profligacy
in the East India College than in any other seminary;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
neither did he say anything of a want of proficiency
in the students; but his main argument was built on the
general principle that a supply of intellectual attainments
will as surely follow an effectual demand for it, as the
supply of any material commodity will follow effectual
demand.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant, I should mention, supported a directly contrary
principle. Mr. Kinnaird dwelt very much on the compulsion
under which parents were of sending their children to
this particular institution. He seemed to me to adopt
Mr. Mill's view of the subject, and his argument would
have been quite as applicable to all colleges if parents were
compelled to send their children to them. He passed over
the compulsion under which parents were to send their
children to college, who wished to bring them up to the
church, etc. In a few minutes' conversation which I had
with him after the debate I urged this objection, and he
answered that they had a choice among a large number
of colleges, whereas in your case they were confined to
this one.</p>

<p>He finished by assuring me that my friend had a bad
cause, that it could not be defended and must fall. Mr.
Impey's speech was badly timed; he should not have immediately
followed Mr. Grant, for he could not then say
anything new, nor could he repeat anything that had been
said half as well as Mr. Grant had said it before. The
debate will be renewed on Tuesday. If you should come
up, I shall expect you in Brook Street. If I do not see you,
and you are disengaged on the Saturday evening following,
I shall be glad to pass a day with you, commencing my
visit at that time....</p>

Gloucestershire, from whence I shall return some time
before your next meeting at the King of Clubs, so that
I hope you will do me the favour to come to Brook Street
when you visit town on that occasion.</p>

<p>... This letter will accompany that part of my MS.<a name="FNanchor_155_157" id="FNanchor_155_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_157" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
which refers to you. I hope I have not in any respect
misapprehended you; and, however we may differ in
opinion on the subjects that we have so often discussed,
I trust you will not think that I have exceeded the bounds
of fair criticism in my remarks on the passages of your
pamphlets which I have selected for animadversion. The
printing goes on briskly. We have had a sheet a day since
the commencement, and eleven sheets are now corrected.
In their printed form they appear worse, in my eyes, than
before; and I need all the encouragement of my partial
correctors<a name="FNanchor_156_158" id="FNanchor_156_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_158" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> to keep alive a spark of hope respecting their
reception. I wish it were fairly out of my hands; and,
that it may not be delayed, I have taken every precaution
that it shall proceed uninterruptedly in my absence. As
yet I have no misgivings about the doctrines themselves;
all my fears are for the language and arrangement, and
above all that I may not have succeeded in clearly showing
what the opinions are which I am desirous of submitting to
fair investigation.</p>

<p>I hope that college affairs will no longer occupy an undue
proportion of your attention, but that you will be able to
give a finishing hand to the works which you are about to
publish. Mrs. Marcet<a name="FNanchor_157_159" id="FNanchor_157_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_159" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> will immediately publish a second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
edition<a name="FNanchor_158_160" id="FNanchor_158_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_160" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>. I have given her my opinion on some passages of
her book, and have pointed out those which I know you
would dispute with me. If she begins to listen to our controversy,
the printing of her book will be long delayed;
she had better avoid it, and keep her course on neutral
ground. I believe we should sadly puzzle Miss Caroline,
and I doubt whether Mrs. B. herself could clear up the
difficulty.</p>

<p>From some conversation which I had yesterday morning
with Mr. Murray, it appears that Torrens has been offering
his book to him; but Murray is very lukewarm in the
negotiation, and really very much underrates Torrens'
talents. He thinks that the sale of Torrens' best work,
that on corn<a name="FNanchor_159_161" id="FNanchor_159_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_161" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>, was very limited; he talked of it's not having
exceeded 150 copies. Since writing the above I have seen
Mr. Hume<a name="FNanchor_160_162" id="FNanchor_160_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_162" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>; he tells me that he has heard that the directors
are about to institute an inquiry into the state of the
college themselves....</p>

<p class="idt">This morning I intended that my letter to you to-day
should inform you that I would have the pleasure of passing
next Saturday and Sunday with you at Haileybury; but a
circumstance has taken place which will make it necessary
for me to go to Bath on Friday next, from which place
I shall again return to London early in the next week. As
you say you will not be in town till after Easter, perhaps
it will be convenient to you to see me at Haileybury on
Saturday se'nnight. If so, I shall be with you on that day,
at your dinner hour; and, if I do not hear from you before,
I shall conclude that you have no engagement which will
render my visit inconvenient.</p>

<p>I mean this day to put the last of my papers in the
printer's hands, and hope he will be able to finish the
printing before my visit to you; but of this I have some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
doubt, as he does not proceed regularly at the same even
pace.</p>

<p>I agree with you that, after having so often heard your
opinions, in contradiction to mine, it would not be of
much use just now, when my book is actually in the
press, to enter again on your reasons for differing with me.
I did not send you the manuscripts with any such intention.
I merely wished you to see that part which related
to you before I published, that I might not inadvertently
misrepresent your statement. I cannot have the least objection
to insert the note you mention<a name="FNanchor_161_163" id="FNanchor_161_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_163" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>, although I cannot
but regret that we should differ so much as to the just and
fair import of the words <i>real price</i>. When you see my book
altogether, you will not perhaps differ from me so much as
you now think you do. You may, and I believe will, object
to the correctness of many of my terms, as they will appear
to you fanciful and not always properly applied; but,
making allowance for such deviations, you will I am sure
agree with much of the matter. On some points, indeed,
there is no difference between us, and on others our chief
disagreement would be in the mode of representing them.
I have written this letter at intervals between other engagements,
as I have been repeatedly interrupted. I now
hear the postman's bell, and must hasten to conclude.</p>

I met Mr. Hamilton<a name="FNanchor_162_164" id="FNanchor_162_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_164" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> at Luneville; he was going
through the country that I had just quitted, and I hope he
was as much pleased with it as I was. I fear that his
engagements at the college made him devote less time to it
than was required to enjoy all its beauties. We found
that we were obliged to hurry over it with more expedition
than we wished. Mrs. Ricardo has been at
Gatcomb rather more than a week, and to-morrow I shall
quit town and join her there. Since Tuesday morning
when I left Paris I have been incessantly travelling in the
day and have not devoted many hours to sleep. I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
not be sorry to have a few days' rest. Your college was
liberal to France, for I not only met Mr. Hamilton there
but Mr. Le Bas<a name="FNanchor_163_165" id="FNanchor_163_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_165" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and the gentleman, whose name I forget,
who teaches the French language at that institution<a name="FNanchor_164_166" id="FNanchor_164_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_166" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you have been enjoying your excursion and that
you found less distress in Ireland than has been represented
as existing there. The prospect of a good harvest
is some consolation for the sufferings which the poor have
been forced to endure; in every country of Europe they
have endured much, and in every one they are anticipating
a return of plenty.</p>

<p>M. Say was very much gratified with your present, and
requested me to forward a letter and a small duodecimo
volume which he has just published<a name="FNanchor_165_167" id="FNanchor_165_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_167" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>. The letter I send
you, but the book as well as his work on Political
Economy, the 3rd edition of which he gave to me, has been
detained at the Custom house at Dover, that they may
have sufficient time to calculate the duty on them. As I
did not wish to stay at Dover till the next day, I requested
the master of the Inn to pay the duty and to forward
them by Osman, who will be on his return from France in a
few days. The book is an interesting little work in the
manner of Rochefoucauld, and appears to me to be ably
done. M. Say was very agreeable and friendly; he dined
with me one day and I with him another. He is engaged
in a commercial concern to which I believe he gives great
attention.</p>

<p>I fear that it will be a long time before you and I meet,
though I shall probably be in London once or twice in the
next three months. I hope you will be disposed to bend
your stops westerly in your winter vacation, and that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
will not fail to pay us a visit at Gatcomb; but not such a
visit as the last,&mdash;I shall not be satisfied with a flying
excursion. Perhaps Mr. Whishaw will favour me with his
company at the same time; if so, with the assistance of my
friend Smith, we should, I hope, contrive to make the time
pass agreeably to both of you. Being very tired and very
sleepy I hasten to conclude.</p>

<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">I thank you very much for your kind letter of the
17th August. I am pleased to hear that your journey to
Ireland turned out so well. The account you give of the
improvements before the check which they received during
the last two years, as well as of the situation of the people,
agrees exactly with what I should expect to find. Humbold[t]
in his account of New Spain<a name="FNanchor_166_168" id="FNanchor_166_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_168" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> points out the very
same evils as you do in Ireland, proceeding too from the
same cause. The land there yields a great abundance of
Bananas, Manioc, Potatoes, and Wheat, with very little
labour, and the people, having no taste for luxuries and
having abundance of food, have the privilege of being idle.
No other advantage would I think result from the disposable
labour being employed in manufactures than in
preventing its being turned to profligate and mischievous
pursuits, dangerous to the public peace. Happiness is the
object to be desired, and we cannot be quite sure that,
provided he is equally well fed, a man may not be happier
in the enjoyment of the luxury of idleness than in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
enjoyment of the luxuries of a neat cottage and good
clothes. And after all we do not know if these would fall
to his share. His labour might only increase the enjoyments
of his employer.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith has heard from Mr. Whishaw; he was at
Paris when he wrote, on the eve of recommencing his
journey. I hope he may enjoy his tour. It is a pity
that he is without an agreeable companion; he is of so
sociable a disposition that he would have had pleasure in
communicating his feelings and comparing them with
these of another intelligent person. Mr. Smith has also
heard from Mr. Warburton, who has set out on the very
same tour that I have been taking, with the addition of
Holland, through which country he means to pass. He has
a very intelligent companion in Dr. Woolaston<a name="FNanchor_167_169" id="FNanchor_167_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_169" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>.</p>

<p>At the very moment that we were beginning to despair of
the weather it has changed and is now beautiful. Our hopes
will I trust not be disappointed, and we shall be enabled
safely to house the abundant crops with which our lands
in every country (<i>sic</i>) are loaded. I doubt whether we
have, even during the late distresses, ceased to advance
as a nation in wealth; but at present I think no one can
doubt that we are again making forward strides in prosperity.
A bad harvest does not perhaps very much check
the progress of wealth; but it materially interferes with
the general happiness.</p>

<p>You flatter me very much by your second perusal of my
book; and I am happy to find that there are but a very
few important points on which we materially differ. I
certainly allow that my theory of value does not hold good
in different countries when profits are different. If you
look to page 156 and the following pages you will see my
ideas on that subject<a name="FNanchor_168_170" id="FNanchor_168_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_170" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>It is only yesterday that I received the book from Dover
which M. Say entrusted me with for you; I send that
and this letter together by Mrs. Ricardo, who is going to
London for a few days; she has undertaken to send my
parcel to the Hertford coach.</p>

<p>... If you go to Bath and do not come over to us I shall
not know how to forgive you.</p>

<p>I have heard lately from Mill; he is still hard at work
in correcting the press (<i>sic</i>) and finishing his book<a name="FNanchor_169_171" id="FNanchor_169_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_171" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>. He
tells me that Sir Samuel and Lady Romilly are expected
at Ford Abbey. I fully expect that I shall see him here
before he returns to London. I do not know when I shall
be obliged to go to town, but whenever it may happen I
will let you know, as I would not willingly forego any
chance of meeting you. Mr. Smith's house is the centre of
attraction for all his able London friends, and he is kind
enough always to allow me to participate in the pleasure
which their company affords him. We have already had
Mr. Warburton and Mr. Belsham, and in a few days he
expects to see Mr. Mallet. Mr. Smith continues to reign
pre-eminent in the good-will of all his neighbours, and
indeed I do not know any one who is entitled to dispute
the palm with him....</p>

<p>This is a sad blundering letter, bad even from me, but
you must excuse it, and will I am sure when I tell you
that I am just recovering from the languor and weakness
caused by the powerful medicines which I have been
obliged to take.... The night before last I was very ill;
yesterday I was better, and to-day I have no complaint

<p class="idt">I said I would write to you when I was going to
London and therefore I now do it, but without much hope
of seeing you there.... It is not my intention, if I can
get my business done, to stay in town beyond Tuesday
morning, unless I had any chance of meeting you there,
which would induce me to defer my return home one
day longer.... Dr. Roget<a name="FNanchor_170_172" id="FNanchor_170_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_172" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> has been on a visit for a
few days at Mr. Smith's; he stayed one evening with us
at Gatcomb. We all very much admire his unassuming
manners, and are well disposed to admit his claims on our
esteem and affection. Sir Samuel Romilly and Lady
Romilly have been on a visit at Mr. Phelps' a near
neighbour of mine. They went from here to Bowood<a name="FNanchor_171_173" id="FNanchor_171_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_173" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> and
from thence they were going to Ford Abbey, Mr. Bentham's
residence. I have since heard of their arrival there,
and they are now probably returned to London.</p>

<p>... Our harvest in this part of the country is almost
entirely got in. The crops are I believe generally good,
and we are very grateful for the fortunate change in the
weather which enabled us to reap and house them in a
state of perfection. We shall now, I hope, for some years
sail before the wind. You and I have always agreed in
our opinions of the power and wealth of the country; we
were not in a state of despair at the discouraging circumstances
with which we were lately surrounded. We

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">I hope we shall be more fortunate in meeting, when
I again visit London.</p>

<p>You think that the low price of labour which has lately
prevailed contradicts my theory of profits depending on
wages, because the rate of interest is at the same time
very low. If interest and profits invariably moved in
the same degree and in the same direction, my theory
might be plausibly opposed; but I consider this as by no
means the case. Although interest is undoubtedly ultimately
regulated by profits, rising when they are high and
falling when they are low, yet there are considerable
intervals during which a low rate of interest is compatible
with a high rate of profit; and this generally occurs when
capital is moving from the employments of war to those
of peace. If goods do not vary in price and the cost of
manufacturing them falls, it is self-evident that profits
must rise; and, if goods do fall in price generally, then it
is not the value of goods or of labour which falls, but the
value of the medium in which they are paid which rises,
and then my theory does not require any rise of profits;
they may even fall.</p>

<p>You ask me if I can show you the fallacy of the following
statement: 'Capital is wholly employed in the purchase
of materials and machinery and the maintenance of
labour. If, from any cause whatever, materials, machinery
and the maintenance of the labourer and his wages fall
considerably in money value, is it <i>possible</i> that the same
amount of monied capital can be employed in the
country?' I answer that it is <i>possible</i> but by no means
probable. Suppose the mines were to produce a diminished
quantity of the precious metals, at the same time that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
materials and machinery were greatly increased in quantity,
might not the increased aggregate quantity of materials
and machinery be of a greater money value than
before, although each particular portion should be at a
less? Might we not by importation appropriate to ourselves
a larger proportion of the mass of money distributed
amongst all the countries of the world? I cannot doubt
the <i>possibility</i> of the case.</p>

<p>In your argument about the stimulus of increased value
and the effects of demand and supply on future wealth,
you do not really differ from my views on this subject so
much as you suppose, for I make profits and wealth to
depend on the real cheapness of labour, and so do you,
for you say that the evils of a dearth will often be more
than counteracted as regards wealth, by the great stimulus
which it may give to industry. I say the same, for I
contend that the evils of a dearth fall exclusively on the
labouring classes, that they perform frequently more labour
not only without receiving the same allowance of food
and necessaries, but often without receiving the same
value for wages or the same recompense in money, whilst
everything is dearer. When this happens, profits, which
always depend on the value of labour, must necessarily
rise.</p>

<p>I thought I had written to you about the additional
matter in your excellent work<a name="FNanchor_172_174" id="FNanchor_172_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_174" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>, although I had not given
it all the examination I intended. I read it as I was
travelling and noticed the pages wherever I saw the
shadow of a difference between us, that I might look at
the passages again when I got home and give them my
best consideration<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[*]</a><a name="FNanchor_173_175" id="FNanchor_173_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_175" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. On my passing through London
when I returned from France, I looked for your book, as I
expected you had sent me a copy, which I think you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
kindly told me you would do; but Mrs. Ricardo had
jumbled that and many other books in a wardrobe, and
it could not be got at till I went to town. I have it now
here and have been reading all the new matter again, and
am surprised at the little that I can discover, with the
utmost ingenuity, to differ from.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_A" id="Footnote_A">*</a> [<i>Foot-note, eventually ousting the text.</i>] In every part you
are exceedingly clear, and time only is wanted to carry
conviction to every mind. The chief difference between us
is whether food or population precedes. I could almost agree
with the statement of the question in p. 47 of third vol.,
which I think is in strict conformity with Sir J. Steuart's
opinion. In speaking of the fall of wages you only once
mention <i>corn</i> wages, but must always mean corn wages
and not money wages. In the note to p. 438 of the third vol.
you agree to my doctrine, but I think in pp. 446, 456
and 457 you forget the admission you had before made,
497 [<i>sic</i>]. You agree with Smith that the monopoly of
the Colony trade raises profits. 502 is in my opinion
wrong and inconsistent with 438. I differ a little from
your views in 506. You do not always appear to me to
admit that the tendency of the Poor Laws is to increase
the quantity of food to be divided, but assume in some
places that the same quantity is to be divided among a
larger number. I can neither agree with Adam Smith nor
with you in 326, 328: a maximum tends to discourage
future production; an undue increase of wages, or poor
laws, tend to promote it. 360, a fall in the price of commodities
and a rise in the value of money are spoken of
as the same thing. 361, a diminution of production is
another way of expressing an abatement of demand. 371,
a combination among the workmen would increase the
amount of money to be divided amongst the labouring class.
These you will observe are slight objections, and I make
them that I may preserve my consistency. They would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
not be understood by the mass of readers, but to you who
are acquainted with my <i>peculiar</i> views, if you please, they
need no explanation....</p>

Bath<a name="FNanchor_174_176" id="FNanchor_174_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_176" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>, during your present vacation, as in that case I might
have hoped to have seen you here. As it is we may
probably be in London nearly at the same time. We
have not yet absolutely fixed on the day for our journey,
but it will not be deferred beyond the middle of next
month. I hope I may see you before your return home.</p>

volume<a name="FNanchor_175_177" id="FNanchor_175_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_177" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> from your pen, although, if you attack me, I am
prepared for nine tenths of our readers deciding in favour
of your view of the question. I want an able pen on my
side to put my opinions in a clear light, and to divest
them of that appearance of paradox which they now wear.
I wish I could assist you to a good title but no one is more
able to give a work the best air and arrangement than
yourself. Have you seen the Review of M. Say and
myself in the British? In some of the remarks you would
I believe agree; yet it is some consolation to me that, after
designating every part of my performance absurd and
nonsensical, they attack you on the subject of Rent, and
say that both you and I have endeavoured to make the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
nature of rent, which was before so clear, obscure. Rent
is nothing more than the hire paid for land. I feel delighted
that they have given me so desirable a companion.
In the Scotsman, a Scotch newspaper, I have been ably
defended&mdash;the writer<a name="FNanchor_176_178" id="FNanchor_176_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_178" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> has evidently understood what I

have got through about half of the first volume. I am not
qualified to give an opinion of its merits, but I am very
much pleased with it. It is very interesting, and is, I
think, calculated to excite a great deal of attention, for it
not only descants on the religion, manners, laws, arts, and
literature, of the Hindus, but compares them with the
religion, manners, etc. of other nations which the world
has generally considered as much inferior to the Hindus;
and, if these in the Hindus are to be deemed marks of a
high state of civilization, Africa, Mexico, Peru, Persia, and
China, might also lay claim to the same character. He
also gives his own sentiments as to what constitutes good
laws, a good religion, a high state of civilization, and
shews at what a very low degree Hindostan deserves
to be estimated for these acquirements<a name="FNanchor_178_180" id="FNanchor_178_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_180" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>. The Political
Economy is, I think, excellent, and the part that I have
read may be considered as the author's view of the progress
of the human mind. I hope it will bring him fame
and reputation,&mdash;his perseverance as well as his other
qualities well deserve it....</p>

<p>Like the Patriarchs of old I am surrounded by all my descendants,
sons, daughters and grandchildren&mdash;they have
assembled from all quarters to visit us, and if I were not afraid
that they would soon become too numerous for the limits of
our house I should insist on its being an annual custom.</p>

<p>You have probably seen in the papers that I am gazetted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
as one of the three from whom the choice of Sheriff is to
be made, and as Col. Berkeley, the first named, will in all
probability be excused on account of his intended application
to the House of Lords for the Peerage which must
otherwise be given to his brother, who is nearly of age,
I shall no doubt be selected. This honour I could well

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In Say's '&#338;uvres Diverses' (vol. i. p. 413) is printed
a letter of Ricardo to Say, dated from Gatcomb, 18th Dec. 1817.
He says amongst other things: 'Since your visit to England, I
have been by degrees retiring from business; and, as our debt is
enormous and the price of stock very high, I have from time to
time withdrawn my capital, and have laid out much of it in land....
My life is made up of successes and cares; hence I am
providing for the future as much as I can, that I may get rid of
anxiety altogether. Our friend Mill is about to publish his book
on India, on which he has been at work for several years. With
powers like his, nothing can fail to become interesting and instructive
under his pen; and I am convinced that this book will
exceed the expectations of his closest friends. It is in type; and
he has kindly given me an early copy. I have read more than
half of the first volume, and I hope it will produce on competent
judges the same impression that it has made on me. What he
says on the government, laws, religion, and manners of the country
is of great weight; and the comparison he draws between the
former condition of Hindostan and its present condition seems to
me to decide the question of the high state of civilization attributed
to the former.... Your <i>Trait&eacute; d'Economie Politique</i> increases in
reputation among us, in proportion as it becomes better known.
Extracts from it (and from my own book) have recently appeared
in the British Review, and its merit has been recognised. I have
not fared so well; the reviewer has found in my book ample
material for criticisms, and hardly a single passage worthy of
praise.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Lord King<a name="FNanchor_180_182" id="FNanchor_180_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_182" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>, Mr. Whishaw and you have done me a great
deal of honour in making my work<a name="FNanchor_181_183" id="FNanchor_181_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_183" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> the subject of your
discussions, but I confess it fills me with astonishment to
find that you think, and from what you say they appear
to agree with you, that the measure of value is not what
I have represented it to be; but that <i>natural price</i>, as well as
<i>market price</i>, is determined by the demand and supply,&mdash;the
only difference being that the former is governed by the
average and permanent demand and supply, the latter by
the accidental and temporary. In saying this do you
mean to deny that facility of production will lower natural
price, and difficulty of production raise it? Will not these
effects be produced after a very short interval, although
the absolute demand and supply, or the proportion of one
to the other, should remain permanently the same? At
any rate then demand and supply are not the sole regulators
of price. I should be glad to understand what Lord
King and you mean by supply and demand. However
abundant the demand it can never permanently raise the
price of a commodity above the expense of its production,
including in that expense the profits of the producers. It
seems natural therefore to seek for the cause of the variation
of permanent price in the expenses of production.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Diminish these and the commodity must finally fall, increase
them and it must as certainly rise. What has this
to do with demand? I may be so foolishly partial to my
own doctrine that I may be blind to its absurdity. I
know the strong disposition of every man to deceive himself
in his eagerness to prove a favourite theory, yet I
cannot help viewing this question as a truth which admits
of demonstration and I am full of wonder that it should
admit of a doubt. If indeed this fundamental doctrine of
mine were proved false I admit that my whole theory falls
with it, but I should not on that account be satisfied with
the measure of value which you would substitute in its place.</p>

<p>I am sorry that you have determined not to publish this
spring.</p>

<p>I have not seen Torrens, and do not know what his intentions
are respecting the work which he promised to
give to the public.</p>

<p>Sir James Mackintosh is indeed a great acquisition in
more respects than one to your College<a name="FNanchor_182_184" id="FNanchor_182_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_184" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>. It must be

<p>I thank you for your congratulations on the hono[u]r
[which] has been conferred on me by the appointment [to]
the office of Sheriff<a name="FNanchor_183_185" id="FNanchor_183_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_185" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>, an honour which I could well have
dispensed with. Under all circumstances I think it best
not to offer an objection to it.</p>

<p>I wish you were of our party to-day. Mr. Whishaw,
Mr. Smyth, Mr. Mallet, Mr. Sharp and Mr. Warburton dine
with me.</p>

<p>I am glad that you have heard Mill's book<a name="FNanchor_184_186" id="FNanchor_184_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_186" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> favourably
spoken of. I hope it may be as well thought of by others

<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>25 May, 1818</i>.</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">I have again to regret that I shall not have you as
an inmate of my house on your next visit to London....
I hope, however, that you will be our daily visitors, or as
often as engagements will permit. I trust that those on
our part will be exhausted before you come, for at no period
have I led so dissipated a life as during this season. The
King of Clubs will meet on the 6th. Let me know whether
Mrs. Malthus and you will favour us with your company
on the 8th, as we should be glad to ask a few friends to
meet you on that day.</p>

<p>The general opinion here is that Parliament will be dissolved
immediately after the prorogation<a name="FNanchor_185_187" id="FNanchor_185_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_187" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>, but as the election
in that case will interfere with the Circuit I cannot
believe that ministers will choose so inconvenient a time.</p>

<p>To-morrow evening there is to be a long debate in the
House of Lords on the Bank Restriction Bill<a name="FNanchor_186_188" id="FNanchor_186_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_188" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>, on which
occasion Lord Grenville means to speak. Lord King mentioned
to me his idea of proposing that the Bank should be
forbid making any dividend on their stock while the price
of gold was above the mint price. I have no doubt that
practically such a measure would operate a reduction of
the currency and its rise to par; but, if the bank directors
were obstinate, it might be attended with the most serious
consequences to widows, orphans, and others, who might
depend on the bank dividends only for their support.</p>

<p>My walks with Mill continue almost daily. I hope you
will sometimes honour us with your company when in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
London. We could make a very tolerable reformer of you
in six walks, if your prejudices be not too strongly fixed.
Indeed I should expect to find that our differences were
not very great, as, if you are favourable to reform at all
and that I believe you are, we should agree on all the important
principles. Sir James Mackintosh has been reading
Bentham, and was just beginning to give me his opinion of
the book<a name="FNanchor_187_189" id="FNanchor_187_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_189" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> when we were interrupted. I hope I shall find
another opportunity of hearing his sentiments, which I am
very eager to do. In a conversation which I yesterday
had with Sharp he told me what he conceived Sir James'
sentiments on reform to be<a name="FNanchor_188_190" id="FNanchor_188_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_190" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>. If he is correct, I do not
think that Sir James and I should be so much opposed to
each other as he now thinks....</p>

<p class="ralign1">
<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>24th June, 1818</i>.</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">Your letter arrived here whilst I was in Gloucestershire.
I came to town last night, having on Monday presided
at the County meeting, and made a return of our two
members.</p>

<p>I thank you for your inquiries after the infant<a name="FNanchor_189_191" id="FNanchor_189_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_191" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> that you
left so ill.... It died ... on the day you left London.
Dr. Holland was surprised at the rapidity with which the
disease advanced....</p>

<p>I believe it is now finally settled that I am not to be in
Parliament, and truly glad I am that the question is at any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
rate settled, for the certainty of a seat could hardly compensate
me for the disagreeables attending the negociation
for it. Mr. Clutterbuck's<a name="FNanchor_190_192" id="FNanchor_190_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_192" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> answer announced to me that
the seat he had in view for me was disposed of; and thus
end my dreams of ambition.</p>

<p>Having once consented to yield to the opinion of my
friends, I let no opportunity slip of getting into the Honourable
House; but I am fully persuaded that, if I consult
my own happiness only, I shall do wisely in stopping where
I am. It is easier to animadvert on the actions of others
than to act with wisdom ourselves; and I strongly fear
that I want both the judgment and discretion which are
requisite to make a tolerable senator. I am surprised at
the kindness and consideration with which my friends
now treat me, and it would be a great want of prudence
to afford them more easy means of sifting my claims.</p>

<p>I am equally pleased with you that Sir Samuel Romilly's
election is going on so well in Westminster, and more
pleased than you will be at Sir Francis Burdett's recent
success on the poll<a name="FNanchor_191_193" id="FNanchor_191_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_193" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>. Sir Francis is, I think, a consistent
man. I believe Bentham's book has satisfied him that
there would be no danger in universal suffrage; but his
main object, I am sure, is to get a real representative
government; and he would think that object might be
[secur]ed by stopping very far short of universal suffrage.
[With] such opinions it is a mere question of prin[ciple]<a name="FNanchor_192_194" id="FNanchor_192_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_194" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
(as to the obtaining of his object) whether he shall ask for
the more or the less extended suffrage. I agree with you
that it would be more prudent to ask for the less, and I
agree also with you in thinking that with our present experience
we should not venture on universal suffrage if it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
could be had. I am glad, however, to find, that you think
the election in Westminster will afford us a fair sample of
the sense of the nation.</p>

<p>I will take care that all demands against you shall be
faithfully discharged.</p>

<p>I have not left myself room to enter at any length into
the question of the comparative advantage of employing
capital in agriculture or on manufactures<a name="FNanchor_193_195" id="FNanchor_193_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_195" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>. If by wealth
you mean as I do all those things which are desirable to
man, wealth I think would be most effectually increased
by allowing corn to be grown or imported as best suits
those concerned in the trade. You say that in the one
case the corn obtained would only be sufficient to support
the workmen employed <i>and pay fully the profits of stock</i>;
and in the other case it would pay in addition the increased
amount of rent, and support an additional population proportioned
to it. Now, <i>if the profits of stock to be paid fully</i>
in one case would be much greater both in value as defined
by you, and in value as defined by me, than in the other,
it is evident that the difference might not only equal the
additional amount of rent but exceed it. I contend that
the profits of stock would be higher than this whole
amount if we consented to import corn, and therefore,
although I will admit that in the case supposed our wealth
has increased by the increase of rent from 1790 to 1818,
yet I would contend that, if the trade had been free, and
corn had been imported in preference to growing it, under
the new and improved circumstances of agriculture, our
wealth would have increased in a still greater ratio than
it now has done....</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In the new Parliament of 1818 Portarlington was represented,
as in the last Parliament, by Richard Sharp, who seems to
have retired in the course of six or seven months, for we find
Ricardo's name in a division list as early as March 2, 1819.
(Hansard, <i>sub dato</i>, p. 846.) It was a pocket borough, and there
is nothing to show that Ricardo ever visited his constituents; but
this did not prevent him from strongly denouncing the system of
election. The biographer of J. B. Say asserts (apparently on pure
conjecture) that Ricardo had bought an estate at Portarlington,
and with it the seat in Parliament as one of its appurtenances
(Say, &#338;uvres Diverses, p. 406): 'Possesseur de vastes domaines,
il s'en trouvait qui, par un abus d&eacute;plor&eacute; par lui-m&ecirc;me, lui donnaient
entr&eacute;e au parlement.' In his Biography of James Mill, p. 172,
Professor Bain speaks as if Ricardo had entered Parliament at the
General Election in 1818.</p></div>

<p class="center">[On outside of letter with the frank <span class="smcap">Minching Hampton</span> (<i>sic</i>), <i>Aug. 20, 1818</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="idt">I am very much obliged to you for the kind manner
in which you express yourself respecting the praise that
has been so lavishly bestowed on me by the reviewer of
my book, in the Edinburgh Review<a name="FNanchor_195_197" id="FNanchor_195_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_197" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>. Immediately on
reading it, I guessed that the writer of the article was Mr.
M'Culloch<a name="FNanchor_196_198" id="FNanchor_196_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_198" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>, for from the publication of my book he appears
sincerely to have embraced the views which I wished
to impress on all my readers. I cannot but feel highly
gratified at his praise, which I should not have been in
anything like an equal degree if it had come from Mr. Mill,
because, though I should not have doubted his sincerity, I
should have imputed much to his friendship and good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
opinion. The praise indeed is far beyond my merits, and
would perhaps have really told more if the writer had
mixed with it an objection here and there.</p>

<p>I do not remember what the question was which I answered
consistently with my general principles in my last
letter, and not having your letter here I cannot refer to it.
I admit that by improvements in agriculture an enormous
quantity of wealth may be created, and that in the natural
progress of society much of that wealth may ultimately go
to landlords in the shape of rent, but that does not alter
the fact of rent being always a transfer, and never a creation
of wealth&mdash;for before it is paid to the landlords as rent
it must have constituted the profits of stock, and a portion
is made over to the landlord only because lands of a poorer
quality are taken into cultivation....</p>

<p>... You must have found your excursion to the Isle
of Wight very pleasant....</p>

<p>You will have seen by the newspapers that I have been
through all the parade and expense, which my office of
sheriff imposes on me, when the judges attend the Assizes,
without any advantage. The judge came into the town after
midnight, by which his commission became void, and, after
sending to London, Jury, Witnesses, Counsel, and Sheriff were
all dismissed to their respective homes. It is expected that
we shall have a new commission in two or three weeks....</p>

<p>I am sorry that you have not made any great progress
in the work that you are about. After the reflection you
have given to the subject I am not surprised that my reviewer
has not shaken your confidence in your opinions.
It would have been little flattering to me if he had, for I
have had many opportunities, and have taken a great deal
of pains to bring you round to my way of thinking without
success. Why should he be so fortunate on the first trial?
The truth I begin to suspect is that we do not differ so
much as we have hitherto thought. I differed very little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
from the opinions expressed in that part of your MS. which
you read to me, but I wish to h[ave an] opportunity of
judging of your system as a whole, and therefore shall be
glad when it comes forth in its printed form.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that Sir J. Mackintosh and Mr. Whishaw
are well, pray remember me kindly to them. If either,
or both of them, should go to Bowood<a name="FNanchor_197_199" id="FNanchor_197_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_199" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> this season, I shall
take it very kind of them if they will come for a few days
to me. The Marquis of Lansdown has promised me a
visit, and it would be particularly agreeable if they would
all come at the same time. Should Mr. Whishaw be as
near to me as Bowood he is already under an engagement
to come. I met the Marquis and Marchioness of Lansdown
at Gloucester; they entered the town on their way home
from a tour, just as I was about leaving it; and owing to
the breaking up of the courts were detained some time for
want of horses. I suppose that you will be confined at
Hertford till the Xmas vacation. I very much wish that
Mrs. Malthus and you would pass a part of that vacation
with us.... Mr. Mill arrived here yesterday evening to
pay me his long promised visit. He brings me no
news, excepting that he dined at Mr. Bentham's with
Mr. Brougham, Mr. Rush<a name="FNanchor_198_200" id="FNanchor_198_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_200" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> the American Ambassador, and
Sir Samuel Romilly. The old gentleman is becoming gay.
A party of four must to him be a formidably large one<a name="FNanchor_199_201" id="FNanchor_199_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_201" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>....</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Between this letter and the next come probably the two
quoted by McCulloch (Ricardo, Works, p. <small>XXVI</small>), to whom (if not to
Mill) they were no doubt addressed: 7th April, 1819, 'You will have
seen that I have taken my seat in the House of Commons. I fear that
I shall be of little use there. I have twice attempted to speak; but I
proceeded in the most embarrassed manner; and I have no hope of
conquering the alarm with which I am assailed the moment I hear
the sound of my own voice.' 22nd June, 1819, 'I thank you for
your endeavours to inspire me with confidence on the occasion of
my addressing the House. Their indulgent reception of me has,
in some degree, made the task of speaking more easy to me; but
there are yet so many formidable obstacles to my success, and
some, I fear, of a nature nearly insurmountable, that I apprehend
it will be wisdom and sound discretion in me to content myself with
giving silent votes.' Happily he did not keep this resolution. It
was at this time that George Grote was introduced to Ricardo,
breakfasting with him at Brook Street (March 23 and 28, 1819),
and walking with him and Mill in St. James's Park and Kensington
Gardens afterwards. Grote used to submit his papers to Ricardo's
judgment, and vied with Mill in admiration of him (Personal Life
of George Grote, p. 36). A letter from Ricardo to Grote, dated
March 1823, is given in Grote's Life (p. 42); Ricardo thanks Grote
for having expressed approbation of his political conduct. One of
Ricardo's last public appearances, outside Parliament, was at a Reform
dinner, where he proposed the chief resolution of the evening in a speech
which Grote helped him to prepare (Bain's Life of J. Mill, p. 208).</p></div>

<p class="idt">I must not longer delay answering your kind letter.
I have had you often in my mind, and was on the point of
writing to you a short time ago, when I received a letter
from Mill enclosing one from Mr. Napier, the editor or
manager of the Encyclopedia Britannica, requesting him
to apply to me to write an article on the Sinking Fund<a name="FNanchor_201_203" id="FNanchor_201_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_203" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
for his publication. The task appeared too formidable to
me to think of undertaking; and I immediately wrote to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Mill to that effect; but that only brought me another letter
from him which hardly left me a choice, and at last I have
consented to try what I can do, but with no hope of succeeding.
I am very hard at work, because I wish to give
Mr. Napier<a name="FNanchor_202_204" id="FNanchor_202_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_204" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> the opportunity of applying to some other
person, without delaying his publication, as soon as I have
convinced Mill and him that I am not sufficiently conversant
with matters of this kind. This business has lately
engrossed all my time, and will probably continue to do so
for at least a week to come.</p>

<p>So you moved from Henley to Maidenhead! You were
determined not to lose sight of the Thames. I shall expect to
see your name entered as a candidate for the annual wherry.</p>

<p>I am glad that you are proceeding merrily with your
work. I now have hopes it will be finished. You have
been very indolent, and are not half so industrious nor so
anxious as I am when I have anything on hand.</p>

<p>I have not been able to give a proper degree of attention
to the subject of your letter. The supposition you make
of half an ounce of silver being picked up on the sea shore
by a day's labour is, you will confess, an extravagant one.
Under such circumstances silver could not, as you say, rise
or fall, neither could labour, but corn could or rather might.
Profits I think would still depend on the proportions of
produce allotted to the capitalist and the labourer. The
whole produce would be less, which would cause its price to
rise, but of the quantity produced the labourer would get
a larger proportion than before. This larger proportion
would nevertheless be a less quantity than before, and
would be of the same money value. In the case you suppose
the rise of money wages does not appear to be neces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>sary
in the progress of cultivation to its extreme limits;
but the reason is that you have excluded the use of capital
entirely in the production of your medium of value. You
know I agree with you that money is a more variable
commodity than is generally imagined, and therefore
I think that many of the variations in the price of
commodities may be fairly attributed to an alteration in
the value of money. It is difficult to conceive that in a
great and civilized country any commodity of importance
could be produced with equal advantage without the
employment of capital. By what you tell me in your
letter<a name="FNanchor_203_205" id="FNanchor_203_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_205" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> you have respected my authority much too highly,
and I do not consent that you should attribute to that respect
the little activity you have displayed in getting your
work finished. I wish that Mrs. Malthus and you would
come to us here at Christmas. I shall then be quite in the
humo[u]r to discuss all the difficult questions on which we
appear to differ. My family is now in a settled state, and
I think I can promise you more comfortable entertainment
than I have yet been able to give you here. You must no
longer plume yourself on being the principal object of Cobbett's<a name="FNanchor_204_206" id="FNanchor_204_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_206" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
abuse. I have come in for my share of it, and just
in the way that I anticipated. Even when he agrees with
you he can find shades of difference which calls [<i>sic</i>] forth
his virulence.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of passing a few days lately in Mr.
Whishaw's company at Mr. Smith's at Easton Grey. He
was in very good spirits and very agreeable. We had
some political discussion, particularly on Reform, and he
was more liberal in his concessions than I have usually
found him. I had Miss Hobhouse heartily on my side;
and Mrs. Chandler, an enthusiast for the Whigs, declared
that mine were the true Whig principles. Mr. Belsham<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
was of the party, but he did not take a decided part. Mr.
Macdonnel, who came with Mr. Whishaw was, I thought,
all but an ally. Are you not weary?...</p>

<span class="smcap">David Ricardo</span>.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note 1.</span>&mdash;The Sinking Fund was a frequent topic of Ricardo's
speeches in the House of Commons. It was a delusion to the
people, who fancied it was paying off their National Debt, and a
snare to the Government, who were constantly tempted to divert
it from its proper purpose. So he declared in his first session
(e.g. May 13, June 9, and June 18, 1819), and so he persisted, in
his last. The following apologue on the subject from his speech
of 28th Feb. 1823, is in the manner of Cobden, and shows
how economists will rather read a difficult truth 'writ small'
than 'writ large:'&mdash;'I have (he says) an income of &pound;1000
a year, and I find it necessary to borrow &pound;10,000, for which
I agree to give up to my creditor &pound;500 per annum. My steward
says to me: "If you will live on &pound;400 a year and give up another
&pound;100 out of your income of &pound;500, that will enable you in a certain
number of years to get completely rid of your debt." I listen to
this good advice, live on &pound;400 a year, and give up annually &pound;600
to my steward in order to pay my creditor. The fist year my
steward pays the creditor &pound;100; then the debt would be &pound;9,900,
and therefore the income [or interest] due to the creditor would be
only &pound;495. But I continue to pay to my steward &pound;600 per annum;
and in the next year the steward pays over &pound;105, and so from
year to year the debt is diminished, &pound;600 being still received by
the steward. At the end of a certain number of years the result
is this&mdash;that out of a yearly reserve of &pound;600, half the debt is paid
off; only &pound;250 is due to the creditor, and &pound;350 remains in the
hands of the steward, his master continuing to live on &pound;400 per
annum. At this period some object occurring to the steward
which he thinks might be of benefit to me or to himself, he
borrows &pound;7000, and devotes the whole &pound;350 in his hands to pay
the interest on that sum. What then becomes of my sinking
fund? Originally I was in debt only &pound;10,000; now I find myself
indebted altogether &pound;12,000; so that instead of possessing a sinking
fund, as I had hoped, I am positively so much more in debt.'
Ricardo's moral was that we should honestly give up pretending
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>to have a sinking fund. One of his own friends remarking that
this was to believe, with the French lady, that the best way to
overcome temptation was to yield to it, Ricardo retorts (speech
of 6th March, 1823): 'If I knew I was going to be robbed of my
purse, I should spend its contents myself first.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note 2.</span>&mdash;It is worth while to quote some parts of the
passages of Cobbett, to which this letter refers. They were too
violent to be taken seriously. If Dr. Johnson really loved a good
hater, he lost much enjoyment by ending his days before Cobbett
wrote. In the letter which appears in the Political Register for
4th Sept. 1819, Cobbett delivers himself as follows: 'I see that
they [the borough-mongers] have adopted a scheme of one Ricardo
(I wonder what countryman he is), who is I believe a converted
Jew. At any rate he has been a 'Change Alley-man for the last
fifteen or twenty years. If the Old Lord Chatham were now alive,
he would speak with respect of the muckworm, as he called the
'Change Alley people. Faith, they are now become <i>everything</i>.
Baring assists at the Congress of Sovereigns, and Ricardo regulates
things at home. The muckworm is no longer a creeping thing;
it rears its head aloft, and makes the haughty borough-lords sneak
about in holes and corners.'... He goes on to say that the doctrines
preached in the 'Courier' and elsewhere about the inutility of ready
money and the convenience of paper show that cash payments are
not really thought practicable by these people. 'This Ricardo says
that the country is happy in the discovery of a paper money, that
it is an improvement in political science. Now if this were true
it would be better to have a paper money in <i>all</i> countries. And
what standard of <i>value</i> would there then be? It is manifest that
there could be none, and that commerce could not be carried on.
Besides, what would be the peril in case of war?' Even as it
is, the French expect us to be in their power in a very few years
from this very cause, &amp;c. In another letter to Hunt in the following
number of the Register he goes on (p. 112): 'I wonder that
Ricardo, hot from the 'Change, who talks of the <i>lower orders</i> in
such goodly terms, and was shocked at the idea of their increasing, ... had
not thought of the fine and copious <i>drain</i> that is continually
going on from England to America. This was a little thing of
sunshine amidst the gloom.' There are other references to Ricardo
in the Register not much more complimentary.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>
<p>Ricardo and Malthus, however, wear their rue with a difference.
Cobbett reaches his spring-tide level of vituperation in the letter
written from Long Island on 6th Feb., and printed in the Political
Register for May 8, 1819 (vol. 34, no. 33): 'To Parson Malthus,
on the Rights of the Poor and on the cruelty recommended by
him to be exercised towards the Poor.'</p>

<p>'Parson, I have during my life detested many men, but never
any one so much as you. Your book ... could have sprung from
no mind not capable of dictating acts of greater cruelty than any
recorded in the history of the massacre of St. Bartholomew. Priests
have in all ages been remarkable for cool and deliberate and
unrelenting cruelty; but it seems to have been reserved for the
Church of England to produce one who has a just claim to the
atrocious preeminence. No assemblage of words can give an appropriate
designation of you; and therefore, as being the single
word which best suits the character of such a man, I call you
Parson, which amongst other meanings includes that of Borough-monger
Tool' (pp. 1019, 1020). He goes on to say he has drawn
up a list of 743 obnoxious parsons, who have dared to exclude
his Register and 'Paper against Gold' from their parish reading-rooms.
'I must hate these execrable Parsons; but the whole mass
put together is not to me an object of such perfect execration as
you, a man (if we give you the name) not to be expostulated with
but to be punished' (1021).</p>

<p>The best commentary on this scurrility may be found in a speech
of Ricardo himself (July 1, 1823, on the 'Petition of Christian
Ministers for free discussion'), where he says that ribald language
should always be allowed full publicity, for it 'offends the common-sense
of mankind' and can hope to make no serious converts.</p></div>

<p class="idt">... I shall go to London alone, on the 22nd, and

<p>I am glad that Mr. Whishaw has expressed satisfaction
with his very short visit here. I was very much pleased
with his company&mdash;no one could be more agreeable, nor
more disposed to be satisfied with everything about him.
We had many conversations on the subject of Parliamentary
Reform, and I was glad to find that our sentiments
accorded much more than I had previously imagined. I
should be quite contented with such a reform as Mr. Whishaw
was willing to grant us. I am certainly not more inclined
than I was before to Radicalism<a name="FNanchor_205_207" id="FNanchor_205_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_207" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>, after witnessing
the proceedings of Hunt, Watson, and Co., if by Radicalism
is meant Universal Suffrage. I fear, however, that I should
not think the moderate reform, which you are willing to
accede to, a sufficient security for good government. Your
scheme of reform, if I recollect right, is as much too moderate
as the universal suffrage plan is too violent: something
between these would give me satisfaction. Do you
think that any great number of the people can really be
deluded with the idea that any change in the representation
would completely relieve them from their distresses? There
may be a few wicked persons who would be glad of a revolution,
with no other view but to appropriate to themselves
the property of others, but this object must be
confined to a very limited number, and I cannot think so
meanly of the understandings of those who are well disposed,
as to suppose that they sincerely believe a reform
in Parliament would give them work, or relieve the country
from the payment of the load of taxes with which we are
now burthened; neither do I observe in the speeches
which are addressed to the mob any such extravagant ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>pectations
held out to them. If there were I am sure they
know better than to believe the speakers who make such
delusive promises. I expect that we shall have a very
stormy session of Parliament.</p>

<p>With respect to my calculations, I have only this to say
in defence of them, that I never brought them forward for
any practical use, but merely to elucidate a principle. It
is no answer to my theory to say that 'it is scarcely possible
that all my calculations should not be necessarily and
fundamentally erroneous,' for that I do not deny; but
still it is true that the proportion of produce in agriculture
or manufactures, retained by the capitalist who sets the
labourers to work, will depend on the quantity of labour
necessary to provide for the maintenance and support of
the labourers.</p>

<p>You ask me 'whether, when land is thrown out of cultivation
from the importation of foreign corn, I consider the
new rate of profits as determined by the state of the land,
or the stationary prices of manufactured and mercantile
products compared with the fall of wages.' You have correctly
anticipated my answer. 'Capital will,' I think, 'be
withdrawn from the land till the last capital yields the
profit obtained (by the fall of wages) in manufactures, on
the supposition of the price of such manufactures remaining
stationary.[']</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that your book will be so soon in the
press, but I regret that the most important part of the conclusions
from the principles which you endeavour to elucidate,
will not be included in it, I mean taxation. In a
letter which I have lately received from Turner<a name="FNanchor_206_208" id="FNanchor_206_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_208" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>, he is full
of regret that the important subject of taxation receives so
little attention from Political Economists;&mdash;at this time he
thinks it peculiarly important, and I cannot but agree with
him. As soon as you have launched your present work, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
hope you will immediately prepare to give us your thoughts
on a subject in which [we] are all practically interested.</p>

<p>I have received a letter also very lately from M'Culloch,
he has been writing an article on Exchanges for the Ency.
Brit., which is very well done, I think; although I cannot
agree with one or two of his definitions.</p>

<p>I finished in my hasty way the article I had undertaken
to do on the Sinking Fund, and then became so disgusted
with it, that I was glad to get rid of it. I have given so
many injunctions not to regard my supposed feelings in
deciding whether it shall or shall not be published, that I
much doubt whether it will ever see the light....</p>

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The gap between the above letter (of 9th Nov. 1819)
and the following (of 4th May, 1820) may be filled up by a letter
of Ricardo to J. B. Say, dated from London, 11th January, 1820
(&#338;uvres Diverses, p. 414). After thanking him for a present
(which appears from Say's reply to have been a French translation
of his 'Pol. Econ. and Taxation') and a letter, he goes on to say:
'I remember hearing you tell me when I saw you in Paris that in
each successive edition of our respective works our opinions would
approximate to each other more and more, and I am convinced that
the truth of the remark will be demonstrated.' Our differences (he
goes on) are becoming rather verbal than substantial. Your chapter
on Value has in my opinion gained considerably. You misrepresent
me, however, on that subject when you say I consider the <i>value</i> of
labour to determine the value of commodities; I hold, on the contrary,
that it is not the value, but 'the <i>comparative quantity of
labour</i> necessary to production which regulates the relative value
of the commodities produced.' Also in regard to Rent, Profits,
and Taxation, you do not observe that my reasoning proceeds on
the assumption that there is in every country 'a land which yields
no rent, <i>or</i> there is a capital employed on the land with a view to
profit merely, and paying no rent for it.' [See 'Pol. Ec. and Tax.'
(McC.'s ed.), ch. xii. p. 107.] The latter you pass over without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
answer. I forward you the 2nd edition of my book, which 'has
nothing new in it, as I have not had the courage to recast it.' He
concludes by saying: 'Political Economy is gaining ground. Sounder
principles are now brought forward. Your treatise is rightly in
the first rank of authorities. The debates in parliament last
session were satisfactory to the friends of the science. The true
principles of currency are at last recognised. I think that on that
point we shall not again go astray. Jeremy Bentham and Mill are
well; I saw them a short time ago.'</p>

<p>Say answers (2nd March, 1820) that their controversy would
certainly end in agreement, if it were not cut short by death, as
a recent fit of apoplexy had made him think probable. He then
briefly defends himself against Ricardo's criticisms. How can you
(he says) determine the quantity and quality of the labour except
by the price paid to obtain it? As to the two parts of your proposition
on Rent, I see no reason for disagreeing with the second
when I differ from the first, and I think (with you) that taxation
in the second case will be shifted to the consumers.</p></div>

need not say that there are many parts of it in which I
quite agree with you. I am particularly pleased with
your observations on the state of the poor; it cannot be
too often stated to them that the most effectual remedy for
the inadequacy of their wages is in their own hands. I
wish you could succeed in ridding us of all the obstacles to
the better system, which might be established.</p>

<p>After the frequent debates between us you will not be
surprised at my saying that I am not convinced by your
arguments on those subjects on which we have long
differed. Our differences may in some respects, I think, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
ascribed to your considering my book as more practical
than I intended it to be. My object was to elucidate
principles, and to do this I imagined strong cases that I
might show the operation of those principles<a name="FNanchor_209_211" id="FNanchor_209_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_211" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. I never
thought, for example, that practically any improvements
took place on the land which would at once double its
produce; but, to show what the effect of improvements
would be, undisturbed by any other operating cause, I
supposed an improvement to that extent to be adopted;
and I think I have reasoned correctly from such premises.
I am sure I do not undervalue the importance of improvements
in agriculture to landlords, though it is possible that
I may not have stated it so strongly as I ought to have
done. You appear to me to overvalue them; the landlords
would get no more rent while the same capital was
employed as before on the land, and no new land was
taken into cultivation; but, as with a lower price of corn
new land could be cultivated and additional capital employed
on the old land, the advantage to landlords would be
manifest. Because the landlord's corn rent would increase
without these conditions, you appear to think he would be
benefited; but his additional quantity of corn would exchange
for no more money nor for any additional quantity
of other goods. If labour were cheaper, he would be
benefited in as far as he would save on the employment of
his gardeners and perhaps some other menial servants, but
this advantage would be common to all who had the same
money revenue, from whatever source it might be derived.
The compliment you pay me in one of your notes<a name="FNanchor_210_212" id="FNanchor_210_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_212" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> is most
flattering. I am pleased at knowing that you entertain a
favourable opinion of me; but I fear that the world will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
think, as I think, that your kind partiality has blinded you
in this instance.</p>

<p>I differ as much as I ever have done with you in your
chapter on the effects of the accumulation of capital<a name="FNanchor_211_213" id="FNanchor_211_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_213" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>. Till a
country has arrived to [<i>sic</i>] the end of its resources from the
diminished powers of the land to afford a further increase,
[I hold] it to be impossible that there should [be at the]
same time a redundancy of capital and of [commodities (?)].
[I] agree that profits may be for a time very l[ow] because
capital is abundant compared with [labour]<a name="FNanchor_212_214" id="FNanchor_212_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_214" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>, they cannot
both, I think, be abundant at one [and the same time].</p>

<p>Admitting that you are correct on this [point, I doubt]
whether the inference you draw is the correct one, and it
[does not seem to me] wise to encourage unproductive
consumption. If individuals would not do their duty in
this respect, government might be justified in raising taxes
for the mere purpose of expenditure.</p>

<p>M<sup>c</sup>Culloch<a name="FNanchor_213_215" id="FNanchor_213_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_215" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> has a short review of your book in the last

from you but does so with the greatest civility and good
humour. Torrens has an interest in (I believe he is editor
of) the Traveller<a name="FNanchor_214_216" id="FNanchor_214_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_216" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>, and as his arguments are on my side, I

<p class="idt">I was very desirous of hearing from you, and was
on the point of telling you so when your letter reached me
from Brighton. Mr. Hump[hre]y Austin, a neighbour of
mine, told me he saw you at Paris and I had heard of your
safe arrival in England. I am quite pleased to hear that
your journey has been agreeable to you; it could not fail
to be so when it gave you the opportunity of seeing and
conversing with the principal literary men of France and
of hearing their opinions on the present state of that
important country. I hope in that quarter there will be
no interruption of the present order of things for some
time to come; but, if they do make a movement, I trust
it will be for the purpose of securing more effectually the
liberty of the people by perfecting as far as human means
can perfect the representative system. There is nothing on
which the happiness of the great body of the people so
much depends. I did not expect that I had so many
readers in France as the number of copies of the French
translation which you tell me have been sold would seem
to imply. I am not surprised that you found few who
understood my theory correctly and still fewer who were
disposed to agree with me. I have not yet succeeded in
making many converts in my own country; but I do not
despair of seeing the number increase; the few I have are
of the proper description, and do not want zeal for the
propagation of the true faith.</p>

<p>I have seen Say's letters to you<a name="FNanchor_216_218" id="FNanchor_216_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_218" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>; it appears to me that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
he has said a great deal for the right cause but not all that
could be said. In one point I think he falls into the same
error as Torrens in his article in the Edinburgh Review<a name="FNanchor_217_219" id="FNanchor_217_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_219" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>.
They both appear to think that stagnation in commerce
arises from a counter set of commodities not being produced
without which the commodities on sale are to be
purchased, and they seem to infer that the evil will not be
removed till such other commodities are in the market.
But surely the true remedy is in regulating future production;
if there is a glut of one commodity, produce less
of that and more of another, but do not let the glut continue
till the purchaser chooses<a name="FNanchor_218_220" id="FNanchor_218_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_220" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> to produce the commodity
which is more wanted. I am not convinced by anything
Say says of me; he does not understand me and is
frequently at variance with himself, when value is the
subject he treats of. In his 4th edition<a name="FNanchor_219_221" id="FNanchor_219_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_221" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>, vol. ii, page 36, he
says everything falls in value, as the quantity is increased,
by the facility of production. Now suppose that you have
to pay for what he calls 'services productifs' in these
commodities which have so fallen in value, will you give
the same value if you give for them the same quantity of
commodities as before? Certainly not, according to his
own admission; and yet he maintains, page 33, that productive
services have not varied if they receive the same
quantity of a commodity, notwithstanding the cost of production
of that commodity may have fallen from 40 to 30
francs per ell. He has two opposite notions about value,
and I am sure to be wrong if I differ with either of them<a name="FNanchor_220_222" id="FNanchor_220_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_222" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the government of France is prejudiced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
against Political Economy. Whatever differences of opinion
may exist amongst writers on that science, they are
nevertheless agreed upon many important principles,
which are proved to demonstration. By an adherence to
these, governments cannot fail to promote the welfare of
the people who are submitted to their sway. What more
clear than the advantages which follow from freedom of
trade, or than the evils resulting from holding out any
peculiar encouragement to population?</p>

<p>I have been reading your book a second time with great
attention, but my difference with you remains as firmly
rooted as ever. Some of the objections you make to me are
merely verbal; no principle is involved in them; the great
and leading point in which I think you fundamentally
wrong is that which Say has attacked in his letters. On
this I feel no sort of doubt. With respect to the word
value, you have defined it one way, I another. We do not
appear to mean the same thing, and we should first agree
what a standard ought to be and then examine which
approaches nearest to an invariable standard, the one you
propose, or that which I propose.</p>

<p>I have not heard of anything further having been written
against you either by McCulloch or Torrens, nor do I know
that they have anything in contemplation. McCulloch has
written me two letters since I saw you last; he does not
say anything about value, and it will probably be a year or
two before he can publish anything on that subject in the
Supplement to the Encyclopedia. In the next Review
there will be an article of his on Tithes, which I have
seen; his principles are right, but I do not like his remedy
for the existing evil<a name="FNanchor_221_223" id="FNanchor_221_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_223" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>.</p>

<p>Mill has been with me here for a fortnight and will stay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>

popular work on Political Economy<a name="FNanchor_222_224" id="FNanchor_222_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_224" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>, in which he will
explain the principles which he thinks correct in the most
familiar way for the use of learners. It is not his intention
to notice any person's opinions or to enter into a
controversy on the disputed points.</p>

<p>I have been looking over my first chapter with a view
to make a few alterations in it before the work goes to
another edition. I find my task very difficult, but I hope
I shall make my opinions more clear and intelligible. I did
intend to defend myself against some of your attacks, but
on reflection I think that, to do myself justice, I must say
so much that I should very inconveniently enlarge the size
of my book, besides which I should be constantly drawing
my readers' attention from the [proper?] subject. If I defend
myself at all, I must do it in [a] separate publication<a name="FNanchor_223_225" id="FNanchor_223_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_225" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>.</p>

<p>Respecting the trial of the Queen I am more than ever
convinced of the impolicy and inexpediency of the proceedings
which have led to it, and am quite sure that the
plea set up that it is a State question is a false one: it
is entered into merely to gratify the resentment and
hostility of one individual who has himself behaved so ill
that whatever he may have to complain of he so fully
merits that no one is bound to enter into his quarrels or
wish for punishment to follow offences to which his own
conduct has been so instrumental.... Gatcomb is very
delightful. I wish you and Mrs. Malthus could give us
your company here before we go to London. Mr. Mill

that a commodity is valuable in proportion to its
utility. This would be true if buyers only regulated the
value of commodities; then indeed we might expect that
all men would be willing to give a price for things in proportion
to the estimation in which they held them; but
the fact appears to me to be that the buyers have the
least in the world to do in regulating price; it is all done
by the competition of the sellers, and, however the buyers
might be really willing to give more for iron than for gold,
they could not, because the supply would be regulated by
the cost of production, and therefore gold would inevitably
be in the proportion which it now is to iron, although it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
probably is by all mankind considered as the less useful
metal.</p>

<p>I think more may be said in defence of his doctrine
of services; they are, I think, the regulators of value,
and, if he would give up rent, he and I should not differ
very materially on that subject. In what he says of
services he is quite inconsistent with his other doctrine
about utility. He appears to me to talk very ignorantly
of the taxation of England. In the note, page 101, he
concedes too much. The difficulty of finding employment
for capital in the countries you mention proceeds from
the prejudices and obstinacy with which men persevere in
their old employments; they expect daily a change for the
better, and therefore continue to produce commodities for
which there is no adequate demand. With abundance of
capital and a low price of labour there cannot fail to be
some employments which would yield good profits; and,
if a superior genius had the arrangement of the capital
of the country under his control<a name="FNanchor_225_227" id="FNanchor_225_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_227" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>, he might, in a very little
time, make trade as active as ever. Men err in their production;
there is no deficiency of demand. If I wanted
cloth and you cotton goods, it would be great folly in us
both, with a view to an exchange between us, for one of
us to produce velvets and the other wine; we are guilty
of some such folly now, and I can scarcely account for the
length of time that this delusion continues. After all, the
mischief may not be so great as it appears. You have
fairly represented the point at issue between us;&mdash;I cannot
conceive it possible, without the grossest miscalculation,
that there should be a redundancy of capital and of labour
at the same time.</p>

<p>When I say mine is the true faith, I mean to express
only my strong conviction that I am right; I hope you
do not attach anything like arrogance to the expression.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
I am in the habit of asserting my opinion strongly to you,
and I am sure you would not wish me to do otherwise.
I am satisfied that you should do the same by yours, and
I dare say you will agree with me that you are not more
inclined to yield to mere authority without being convinced
than I am<a name="FNanchor_226_228" id="FNanchor_226_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_228" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>. I affirm with you that 'if the farmer
has no adequate market for his produce, he will soon
cease to distribute more necessaries to his labourers,' with
a view to the production of more necessaries; but will he
therefore leave that part of his capital inactive, will not he
or somebody else employ it in producing something which
will meet an adequate market? You speak of the relative
<i>utility</i> of our two definitions of value. I confess that your
definition<a name="FNanchor_227_229" id="FNanchor_227_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_229" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> does not convey to my mind anything approximating
to the idea I have ever formed of value. To say
that real value as applied to wages implies the quantity
of necessaries given to the labourer, at the same time that
you agree that those necessaries are as variable as anything
else, appears to me a contradiction. Political
Economy you think is an enquiry into the nature and
causes of wealth; I think it should rather be called an
enquiry into the laws which determine the division of the
produce of industry amongst the classes who concur in
its formation. No law can be laid down respecting
quantity, but a tolerably correct one can be laid down
respecting proportions. Every day I am more satisfied
that the former enquiry is vain and delusive, and the latter
only the true object of the science. You say that my
proposition, 'that with few exceptions the quantity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
labour employed on commodities determines the rate at
which they will exchange for each other, is not well founded.'
I acknowledge that it is not rigidly true, but I say that
it is the nearest approximation to truth, as a rule for
measuring relative value, of any I have ever heard. You
say demand and supply regulates value [<i>sic</i>]; this I think
is saying nothing, and for the reason I have given in the
beginning of this letter: it is supply which regulates
value<a name="FNanchor_228_230" id="FNanchor_228_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_230" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>, and supply is itself controlled by comparative cost
of production. Cost of production, in money, means the
value of labour as well as profits. Now, if my commodity
be of equal value with yours, its cost of production must
be the same. But cost of production is, with some deviations,
in proportion to labour employed. My commodity
and your commodity are both worth &pound;1000; they will
therefore probably have the same quantity of labour
realized in each. But the doctrine is less liable to objections
when employed not to measure the whole absolute
value of the commodities compared, but the variations
which from time to time take place in relative value.
To what causes, I mean permanent causes, can these
variations be attributed? To two and to two only, one
insignificant in its effects, a rise or fall of wages, or what
I think the same thing a fall or rise of profits, the other of
immense importance, the greater or less quantity of labour
that may be required to produce the commodities. From
the first cause no great effects may follow because profits
themselves constitute but a small portion of price, and no
great addition or deduction can be made on their account.
To the other cause no very confined limit can be assigned,
for the quantity of labour required to produce commodities
may vary to double or treble.</p>

<p>The subject is difficult, and I am but a poor master of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
language, and therefore I shall fail to express what I mean.
My first chapter<a name="FNanchor_229_231" id="FNanchor_229_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_231" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> will not be materially altered; in principle

<p class="idt">I have been living in a state of great uncertainty
whether I should be obliged to go to London or not. It
seems to be settled that Parliament will be prorogued, and
therefore I do not think it necessary to take a journey to
town for the sole purpose of hearing the usher of the black
rods give his three taps at the door of the House of Commons
with his rod of office, and which [<i>sic</i>] we are assured
by Hobhouse would be laid about his back, if he presumed
so to disturb a reformed House of Commons. The political
horizon does not appear to be clearing up. It is always
unwise for a Government to set itself against the declared
opinion of a very large class of the people, and it is more
particularly so when the point in dispute is one trifling in
itself, and of no real importance to the state. Should the
public be kept in this agitated state on a question whether
the Queen should be allowed a palace, or whether her
name should be inserted in the Liturgy? Nothing can be
more unjustifiable than to risk the public safety on such
questions as these, for after raising the discussion there is
no safety either in yielding or resisting.</p>

<p>You say in your last letter 'that you are fortified with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
new arguments to prove demonstratively that a neat
revenue is absolutely impossible under the determination
to employ the whole produce in the production of necessaries,
and consequently that if there is not an adequate
taste for luxuries and conveniences or unproductive labour,
there must necessarily be a general glut.' I shall not
trouble you to bring forward these arguments, for with a
very slight alteration I should entirely concur in your
proposition. If I recollect right, it is the very exception
which I made<a name="FNanchor_231_233" id="FNanchor_231_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_233" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> and which you mention in your book.
You must collect your stock of arguments to defend more
difficult points than this.</p>

<p>I am quite sure that you are the last man who would
misstate an adversary, knowingly, yet I find in your book
some allusions to opinions which you represent as mine
and which I do not really hold. In one or two cases you,
I think, furnish the proof that you have misapprehended
me, for you represent my doctrines one way in one place,
and another way in another. After all the difference between
us does not depend on these points; they are very
secondary considerations.</p>

<p>I have made notes on every passage in your book which
I dispute, and have supposed myself about publishing a
new edition of your work, and at liberty to mark the passage
with a reference to a note at the bottom of the page.
I have in fact quoted three or four words of a sentence,
noting the page, and then added my comment. The part
of your book to which I most object is the last. I can see
no soundness in the reasons you give for the usefulness of
demand on the part of unproductive consumers. How
their consuming, without reproducing, can be beneficial to
a country, in any possible state of it, I confess I cannot
discover. I have also written some notes on M. Say's
letters to you, with which I am by no means pleased. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
is very unjust to me, and evidently does not understand
my doctrine; and for the opinions which we hold in common
he does not give such satisfactory reasons as might,
I think, be advanced. In fact he yields points to you,
which may almost be considered as giving up the question,
and affording you a triumph. In Say's works generally,
there is a great mixture of profound thinking, and of
egregious blundering. What can induce him to persevere
in representing utility and value as the same thing? Can
he really believe that our taxation operates as he describes<a name="FNanchor_232_234" id="FNanchor_232_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_234" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>,
and can he think that we should be relieved, in the way
he represents, by the payment of our national debt<a name="FNanchor_233_235" id="FNanchor_233_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_235" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>?</p>

<p>I shall not dispute another proposition in your letter.
'No wealth,' you say, 'can exist unless the demand or
the estimation in which the commodity is held exceeds the
cost of production.' I have never disputed this. I do not
dispute either the influence of demand on the price of corn
or on the price of all other things; but supply follows
close at its heels and soon takes the power of regulating
price in his [<i>sic</i>] own hands, and in regulating it he is
determined by cost of production. I acknowledge the
intervals on which you so exclusively dwell, but still they
are only intervals. 'Fifty oak trees valued at &pound;20 each do
not contain as much labour as a stone wall in Gloucestershire
which costs &pound;1000[']<a name="FNanchor_234_236" id="FNanchor_234_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_236" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>. I have answered your question;
let me ask you one. Did you ever believe that I
thought fifty oak trees would cost as much labour as the
stone wall? I really do not want such propositions to be
granted in order to support my system....</p>

<p class="idt">... I am very glad to hear of your intention of
paying me a visit here. I hope it will be for a longer time
than you mention. I am desired by Mrs. Ricardo to say
that it would give her great pleasure to see Mrs. Malthus
and your three children.... There is a coach which leaves
London three times a week at five o'clock in the evening,
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This coach goes to
Minchinhampton, one mile from our house; it carries four
inside, travels at a very good pace, and sets off from the
Angel Inn, St. Martin's-le-Grand. There is also a morning
coach which goes from Gerard's Hall, Basing Lane, Cheapside,
three times a week in the morning at a quarter before
six. I believe this coach goes on Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday; it is a Stroud coach and does not come nearer
to our house than within four miles on the Cirencester
Road. If you prefer this coach, we will send for you to
the place where the roads diverge. This is of course in
case Mrs. Malthus does not accompany you....</p>

<p>It is true the case<a name="FNanchor_236_238" id="FNanchor_236_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_238" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> in my book is stated to be temporary,
and in my opinion it can only be temporary
because it cannot exist when the population has increased
with the demand for people. When we meet we must
agree upon the meaning to be attached to 'a neat surplus
from the land'; it may mean the whole material produce
after deducting from it what is absolutely necessary to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
feed the men who obtained it, or it may mean the value of
the produce which falls to the share of the capitalist, or to
the share of the capitalist and landlord together. If the
first be neat surplus it is equally so whether given to
labourers, capitalists, or landlords. If the second it may
fall short of giving as great a value to the capitalist as
he expended in obtaining it, and therefore for him there
would be no neat produce. This term neat produce is
used ambiguously in your book, and is made the ground
of an observation on something [which I s]aid about neat
and gross produce. The observation is [just] or not just,
according to the meaning attached to the term neat produce;
but more of this when we meet.</p>

<p>Knowing as I do how much we are influenced by taking
a particular view of a subject, and how difficult it is to destroy
a train of ideas which have long followed each other
in the mind, I will not say I am right about the effects of
unproductive demand, and therefore it is possible that five
years hence I may think as you do on the subject, but at
present I do not see the least probability of such a change,
for every renewed consideration of the question confirms
me in the opinion which I have long held.</p>

<span class="smcap">David Ricardo</span>.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;On the 8th May, 1821, Ricardo writes to J. B. Say from
London (Say, &#338;uvres Diverses, p. 416), acknowledging receipt of
Say's 'Letters to Malthus,' and sending him an early copy of the 3rd
edition of his 'Pol. Econ. and Tax.' He finds fault again with Say's
use of the word Value. He adopts Say's doctrine of 'productive
services'; but 'rent being the effect and not the cause of the rise of
prices, I submit afresh to you the question whether it is not well to
leave rent out of account when we are estimating the comparative
value of the productions of the soil. Suppose that I have before me
two loaves, the one from the best land in the country, a land yielding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>three or four pounds sterling per acre, the other from a land rented
at about three or four shillings. The two are precisely of the same
quality and the same price. You would say that the price of the
one is largely a payment for the service of the soil, while it gives
little profit for the capital and the labour that have made that
land produce. This is incontestable; but what consequence can
you draw from it for our practical guidance? What we want
to know is the general law which regulates the value of bread
relatively to the value of all other things; and I believe that we
shall find that one of those loaves, the one that comes from the
land that pays little or no rent, determines the value of the whole
of the bread; consequently its value, compared with that of all other
things, depends on the quantity of labour employed in its production,
comparatively with the quantity of labour employed in every
other production. Your book (the Trait&eacute;) would have gained much
if you had considered the laws of rent and profits more deeply: 'Adam
Smith was certainly wrong in supposing that the rate of profits depends
on the amount of accumulated capitals without regard to the
population, and the means of providing for it.' In other points
I agree with your book and with the greater part of your 'Letters
to Malthus.' 'Mr. Malthus and I see each other frequently, without
convincing one another. I am glad to be able to inform you that
economical science is more and more studied by the youth of this
country. We have recently formed a club of political economists,
in which we are proud to include Messrs. Torrens, Malthus, and
Mill. Many others besides are actively maintaining the principles
of free trade, though their names are not so well known to the
public.'</p>

<p>In his reply (Paris, 19th July, 1821) Say points out that Ricardo
neglects the distinction between 'natural wealth' and 'social
wealth,' or he would agree more than he does with Say in his
view of value. 'Value in use,' if it means anything, means
utility pure and simple, and we may leave out the 'value.'
But utility may be gratuitously presented to us by nature, or
added by our labour and outlay. We measure the new utility
thus added, not as you say by the <i>quantity of labour</i> it costs us,
but by the different <i>quantities of another product</i> which are given
for it (for the new utility not for the nature-given utility) by others.
For instance, a pound of iron is perhaps 2000 times less valuable
than a pound of gold, though the utility of the iron may be equal,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>if not superior, to that of the gold; and the reason is that nearly
all the utility of the iron is a gratuitous gift of nature to us. I neglect,
therefore, the distinction of value in use and value in exchange deliberately,
for I think Political Economy has to do only with the
latter. As to the two loaves, the phenomenon you speak of is due,
first, to the appropriation of land, apart from which such produce of
the soil as was got without labour would cost nothing to anybody,&mdash;second,
taking things as they are, to the fact that progress in production
essentially consists in the substitution of nature's gratuitous
services for our own costly ones&mdash;our ideal being the complete
displacement of the latter by the former, which would make us all
'richer than David Ricardo.' Again, I consider that the determining
causes of value include the causes that influence demand as
well as supply, the cost to the demander of the productive services
he offers in exchange, and not only the cost in labour of the article
supplied. I am glad to hear of your Club. 'What I desire above
all is that such economical principles as are not abstract, but are
only the frank exposition of facts and their consequences, should
be diffused among all classes of citizens. We have need not of
controversialists expert in syllogistic weapons, but of practical
economists; and all that is wanted, for that, is notions accessible
to plain common sense, which I fear we repel by our too abstract
reasonings.' If you admit strangers, I should be glad to be a
member. He adds in a postscript that his eulogies (in the letters
to Malthus) of the Essay on Population have been taken by some
English writers as ironical; and he would like Ricardo to tell
Malthus this is not so; he considers the position of the Essay
impregnable, and has a genuine esteem for the author (&#338;uvres
Diverses, pp. 418-22). Say was of opinion that the time had not yet
come for setting up a dogmatic orthodoxy in economical doctrines;
and he begins the above letter by saying to Ricardo:&mdash;'I see in
your book a new proof that the subjects of political economy are
prodigiously complicated, for, though you and I are both seeking
the truth in good faith, yet after devoting whole years to sounding
the depths of its fundamental questions we find several points on
which we do not agree. It is well we are agreed on the essential
point, the possibility of the progress of man in wealth and happiness,
as well as on the means needful to that end. We reach the
same conclusions, though sometimes in different ways' (p. 418).</p></div>

manner I have avowed them<a name="FNanchor_239_241" id="FNanchor_239_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_241" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>. Two or three letters have
passed between us on this subject; in his last, he appears
to me to acknowledge that the effect of the use of machinery
may be to diminish the annual quantity and value of
gross produce. In yielding this, he gives up the question,
for it is impossible to contend that with a diminished
quantity of gross produce there would be the same means
of employing labour. The truth of my propositions on this
subject appear to me absolutely demonstrable. McCulloch
is lamenting over the departure from my plan of currency,
and means to make it the subject of an article in the
Edinburgh Review, as he has already done in the Scotsman.
I very much regret that in the great change we have made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
from an unregulated currency to one regulated by a fixed
standard we had not more able men to manage it than the
present Bank directors. If their object had been to make
the revulsion as oppressive as possible, they could not have
pursued measures more calculated to make it so than those
which they have actually pursued. Almost the whole of
the pressure has arisen from the increased value which their
operations have given to the standard itself. They are indeed
a very ignorant set.</p>

<p>You are right in supposing that I have understood you
in your book not to profess to enquire into the motives for
producing, but into the effects which would result from
abundant production. You say in your letter&mdash;'We see
in almost every part of the world vast powers of production
which are not put into action, and I explain this
phenomenon by saying that from the want of the proper
distribution of the actual produce adequate motives are not
furnished to continued production.' If this had been what
I conceived you to have said, I should not have a word to
say against you; but I have rather understood you to say
that vast powers of production are put into action and the
result is unfavourable to the interests of mankind; and you
have suggested as a remedy either that less should be produced
or more should be unproductively consumed. If you
had said 'After arriving at a certain limit, there will in
the actual circumstances be no use to try to produce more;
the end cannot be accomplished, and, if it could, instead of
more, less would belong to the class which provided the
capital,' I should have agreed with you; yet in that case
I should say the real cause of this faulty distribution would
be to be found in the inadequate quantity of labour in the
market, and would be effectually cured by an additional
supply of it. But I say with you there could be no adequate
motive to push production to this length, and therefore
it would never go so far. I do not know whether I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
am correct in my observation that 'I say so with you,' for
you often appear to me to contend not only that production
can go on so far without an adequate motive, but that it
actually has done so lately, and that we are now suffering
the consequences of it in stagnation of trade, in a want of
employment for our labourers, etc., etc.; and the remedy
you propose is an increase of consumption. It is against
this latter doctrine that I protest, and give my decided
opposition. I acknowledge there may not be adequate
motives for production, and therefore things will not be
produced; but I cannot allow first that with these inadequate
motives commodities will be produced, and secondly
that, if their production is attended with loss to the producer,
it is for any other reason than because too great a
proportion is given to the labourers employed. Increase
their number and the evil is remedied. Let the employer
consume more himself and there will be no diminution of
demand for labour; but the pay of the labourer, which was
before extravagantly high, will be reduced. You say in
your letter, 'If an increased power of production be not
accompanied by an increase of unproductive expenditure,
it will inevitably lower profits and throw labourers out of
employment.' In this proposition I do not wholly agree.
First I say it must be accompanied with an increase either
of productive or of unproductive expenditure. If the labourer
receives a large proportion of the produce as wages,
all that he receives more than is sufficient to prompt him
to the necessary exertions of his powers, is as much unproductive
consumption as if it were consumed by his master,
or by the State; there is no difference whatever. A master
manufacturer might be so extravagant in his expenditure,
or might pay so much in taxes, that his capital might be
deteriorated for many years together; his situation would
be the same if, from his own will or from the inadequacy
of the population, he paid so much to his labourers as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
leave himself without adequate profits or without any
profits whatever. From taxation he might not be able to
escape, but from this last most unnecessary <i>unproductive</i>
expenditure he could and would escape, for he could have
the same quantity of labour with less pay, if he only saved
less; his saving would be without an end, and would
therefore be absurd. You perceive then I fully admit more
than you ask for; I say that, under these circumstances,
without an increase of unproductive expenditure on the
part of the masters profits will fall; but I say this further
that even with an increased unproductive consumption
and expenditure by the labouring classes profits will fall.
Diminish this latter unproductive expenditure and profits
will again rise; this may be done two ways, either by an
increase of hands which will lower wages, and therefore
the unproductive expenditure of the labouring class, or by
an increase of the unproductive expenditure of the employing
class, which will also lower wages by reducing the
demand for labour.</p>

<p>I fear I have been guilty of needless repetition, but I
have really a great wish to show you what the points are
on which our difference really exists. I am glad to hear

</p>

<p class="idt">I think that the concession which I have made will not
bear the construction you have put upon it. 'An increased
power of production must be accompanied with an increase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of productive or unproductive expenditure.' This is the
sentence on which you have remarked, and you say could
not be true if the gross produce were diminished. Certainly
not, but I have never said that with an increased power of
production the gross produce would be diminished; I have
never said that machinery enables you to get a greater
quantity of gross produce; my sole complaint against it is
that it sometimes actually diminishes the gross produce.</p>

<p>With respect to the particular subject of discussion between
us, you seem to be surprised that I should understand
you to say in your book 'that vast powers of production
are put into action, and the result is unfavourable to the
interests of mankind.' Have you not said so? Is it not
your objection to machinery that it often produces a quantity
of commodities for which there is no demand, and that
it is the glut which is the consequence of quantity which is
unfavourable to the interests of mankind? Even as you
state your proposition in your present letter, I have a right
to conclude that you see great evils in great powers of production
from the quantity of commodities which will be the
result, and the low price to which they will fall. Saving, you
would say, would first lead to great production, then to low
prices, which would necessarily be followed by low profits.
With very low profits the motives for saving would cease,
and therefore the motives for increased production would
also cease. Do you not then say that increased production
is often attended with evil consequences to mankind because
it destroys the motives to industry, and to the keeping
up of the increased production? Now in much of this I
cannot agree with you. I indeed allow that the case is
possible, to conceive of saving being so universal that no
profit will arise from the employment of capital; but then
I contend that the specific reason is because all that fund,
which should, and in ordinary cases does, constitute profit,
goes to wages and immoderately swells that fund which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
destined to the support of labour. The labourers are immoderately
paid for their labour, and they necessarily become
the unproductive consumers of the country. I agree
too that the capitalists being in such a case without a sufficient
motive for saving from revenue to add to capital, will
cease doing so, will, if you please, even expend a part of
their capital; but I ask what evil will result from this?
None to the capitalist, you will allow, for his enjoyments
and his profits will be thereby increased, or he would continue
to save; none to the labourers, for which we should
repine, because their situation was so exceedingly favourable
that they could bear a deduction from their wages and
yet be in a most prosperous condition. Here it is where
we most differ. You think that the capitalist could not
cease saving on account of the lowness of his profits, without
a cessation in some degree of employment to the people.
I, on the contrary, think that with all the abatements from
the fund destined to the payment of labour, which I acknowledge
would be the consequence of the new course of
the capitalists, enough would remain to employ all the
labour that could be obtained and to pay it liberally, so
that in fact there would be little diminution in the quantity
of commodities produced; the distribution only would
be different; more would go to the capitalists and less to
the labourers.</p>

<p>I do not think that stagnation is a proper term to apply
to a state of things, in which for a time there is no motive
to a further increase of production. When in the course of
things profits shall be so low from a great accumulation of
capital and a want of means of providing food for an increasing
population, all motive for further savings will
cease; but there will be no stagnation; all that is produced
will be at its fair relative price, and will be freely
exchanged. Surely the word stagnation is improperly applied
to such a state of things, for there will not be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
general glut, nor will any particular commodity be necessarily
produced in greater abundance than the demand shall
warrant.</p>

<p>You say, 'We know from repeated experience that the
money price of labour never falls till many workmen have
been for some time out of work.' I know no such thing;
and, if wages were previously high, I can see no reason
whatever why they should not fall before many labourers
are thrown out of work. All general reasoning, I apprehend,
is in favour of my view of this question, for why
should some agree to go without any wages while others
were most liberally rewarded? Once more I must say that
a sudden and diminished demand for labour in this case
must mean a diminished reward to the labourer, and not a
diminished employment of him; he will work at least as
much as before, but will have a less proportion of the produce
of his work, and this will be so in order that his
employer may have an adequate motive for employing him
at all, which he certainly would not have if his share of the
produce were reduced so low as to make increased production
an evil rather than a benefit to him. 'It is' (never)
'said that an increase of unproductive consumption among
landlords and capitalists may not sometimes be the proper
remedy for a state of things in which the motives for production
fail.' I know of no one who has recommended
a perseverance in parsimony even after the profits of
capital have vanished. I have never done so, and I should
be amongst the first to reprobate the folly of the capitalist
in not indulging himself in unproductive consumption.
I have indeed said that nothing can be produced for which
there will not be a demand, unless from miscalculation,
while the employment of stock affords even moderate
profits; but I have not said that production may not in
theory be pushed so far as to destroy the motive on the
part of the capitalist to continue producing to the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
extent. I believe it might possibly be pushed so far, but
we have never witnessed it in our days, and I feel quite
confident that, however injurious such a state of things may
be to the capitalist, it is so only because it is attended with
disproportionate and unusual benefits to the labourers.
The remedy, therefore, and the sole remedy, is a more just
distribution of the produce; and this can be brought about
only, as I said in my last letter, by an increase of workmen
or by a more liberal unproductive expenditure on the part
of the capitalists. I should not make a protest against an
increase of consumption as a remedy to the stagnation of
trade, if I thought as you do, that we were now suffering
from too great savings; as I have already said, I do not see
how stagnation of trade can arise from such a cause.</p>

<p>We appear then not to differ <i>very</i> widely in our general
principles, but more so respecting the applications of them.
Such and such evils may exist; but the question is do they
exist now? I think not; none of the symptoms indicate
that they do, and in my opinion increased savings would
alleviate rather than aggravate the sufferings of which we
have lately had to complain. Stagnation is a derangement
of the system, and not too much general production, arising
from too great an accumulation of capital.</p>

<p class="idt">Without imputing the least blame to you, I fear that
I do not quite understand your 'knotty point.' You
appear to me to compare things together, which cannot,
under any supposable circumstances, be made the subject
of comparison. You compare a commodity, in the production
of which the advances in labour remain the same
while the profits of stock diminish, to another commodity
'obtained by a given quantity of labour, a given quantity
of capital, and a given rate of profits.' Is not this supposing
two rates of profit at the same time? Perhaps this
was not meant, and your question was asked on the supposition
of profits varying equally in all trades. If so, I
have no hesitation in answering that, if, from an increased
quantity of labour on the land, corn should appear to have
doubled in money price, and not from any increased facility
in the production of money, we ought to say, as we always
do say, that corn had risen a hundred per cent., and
not that money had fallen fifty. In differing on this
point we in reality come to our old dispute, whether the
quantity of labour in a commodity should be the regulator
of its value, or whether the value of all things should, under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
all circumstances, be estimated by the quantity of corn for
which they would exchange. You say 'we cannot surely
assume that the cost of producing the necessaries of the
labourer is low absolutely when the land is productive, if
what is gained by the small quantity of labour employed is
counterbalanced by the very high rate of profits.' I, of
course, should say the cost of these necessaries was low if
they were produced with little labour, but would not you,
who adopt another measure and <i>sometimes</i> think value is to
be estimated by the quantity of things generally which the
commodity could command, would you not say, that the
cost of these necessaries was small in value, agreeing, as you
would, that they would not command an abundance of
other things? I do not know what you mean by the low
cost of necessaries being counterbalanced by the very high
rate of profits. If a hundred quarters of corn be to be
divided between my labourers and me, its cost being made
up of wages and profits, its cost will be the same, whether
profits be high or low, and this division will in no degree
affect the price of the corn; but, if at a subsequent time
eighty quarters only can be obtained with the same labour
and capital, and in consequence a greater proportion of the
eighty be given to the labourers than was before given of
the hundred, corn will rise absolutely both in my measure
and in yours. It is I who am willing to take some one or
more of the external commodities<a name="FNanchor_245_247" id="FNanchor_245_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_247" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> in the production of
which, while the advances in labour increase in money
value, the profits of stock diminish, as a steady measure,
but which you so often reject, and insist that, whether the
produce of a given quantity of labour be a hundred or
eighty quarters, in either case, corn has remained a steady
measure of value. In the case you have supposed, you say
that the commodity, in which the same advances for labour
were made, while profits diminished, 'would not only fall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
one half relatively to corn, but it would appear to do so
estimated in any common external commodity which had
all along been produced by the same quantity of labour,
<i>and at the same rate of profits</i>.' I wish you had named this
commodity. In the first place I deny that it would be
produced at the same rate of profits, for there cannot be
two rates of profit at the same time in the same country,
and secondly I contend that this commodity would also fall
to one half relatively to corn, and therefore would appear
invariable when compared with the other commodities.</p>

<p>Perhaps by external commodity, you mean a foreign
commodity to be imported from abroad. If so, why should
not that commodity vary in reference to corn in the same
degree as any home made commodity? If a hogshead of
claret were worth a certain quantity of cloth, of hats,
of hardware, etc., etc., would its relative value to these
things alter because it was more difficult to raise corn in
England, and its price rose because we refused to import it
from other countries? To me it appears most clear that
claret would not vary as compared with the things which
I before enumerated, and that it would vary as compared
with corn. Pray think of this and tell me whether I am
not right. In the postscript to your letter you ask 'In the
two extreme cases of the highest profits, and the lowest
profits on the land, may not corn and labour remain of the
same value estimated in some external commodity, although
in the interval considerable variations may have taken
place from supply and demand?' I answer, no, it could not
remain of the same value estimated in home commodities,
and as it is by means of these home commodities that we
should purchase the external commodities, I cannot see the
slightest reason for supposing that these commodities so
exchanged could alter in relative value. I hope I have made
myself understood. I am glad you approach a little
towards my views, I wish you had told me to what extent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>

<p class="idt">The case you put to me appears to me to be an impossible
one. How can all countries produce their commodities
with the same quantity of labour, all, except one,
produce their <i>corn</i> with the same quantity of labour also,
and yet all, the one not excepted, have their profits on
capital at the same rate? The one which you suppose to
raise its corn with only half the quantity of labour required
in the others would in all probability obtain its labour at
a much cheaper price, and consequently profits would be
higher in that country. If indeed a free trade should be
established between all these countries, then their profits
might be all nearly at the same rate, because the price of
corn and necessaries estimated in quantity of labour would
be nearly the same in all. In carrying on this supposed
case we must be informed whether the country in which
corn is obtained with comparatively little labour can continue
to obtain it on the same terms, after she is called upon
to supply the markets of other countries; if she can, then
the comparative prices of corn and commodities will be
altered in all countries; in the country producing the cheap
corn, money will be rather at a higher level than before, and
therefore corn rather dearer; but commodities generally
will be at no higher price;&mdash;they will be indeed rather
cheaper, because they will be imported from abroad and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
from countries where the level of currency will be somewhat
reduced; and therefore the cost price of commodities
in those countries will be lower, and consequently they can
be sold cheaper to the country importing them. Bulky
commodities and the price of labour will only be raised in
this particular country, because the level of currency will
be somewhat raised; labour will in the real measure of
value be rather lowered, that is to say, the portion of
produce paid to the labourer, manufactured and raw produce,
together, will probably be rather increased, but in
consequence of free trade and a better distribution of
capital, the proportion of the whole produce of a given
capital which the labourer will receive, will be diminished;
his proportion will really be obtained with less
labour.</p>

<p>The benefit to other countries cannot be doubted; corn
and labour will fall very greatly in those countries, and
consequently profits will rise, and, as part of their exports
in return for corn must in the first instance be money, the
general level of currency will be reduced and commodities
generally will fall, not because they can be produced
cheaper but because they are measured by a more valuable
money. This is on the supposition that corn can continue
to be produced with little labour in the excepted country;
but suppose the increased demand for corn should oblige
this country to cultivate poorer land, then the price of corn
would rise from another cause besides the higher level of
currency; and, if this difficulty should be nearly as great
as in other countries, corn would be nearly as high; but,
while it could afford on any terms to export corn for
commodities, there would be previously to the importation
of commodities an influx of the precious metals and a
higher level of currency. Without such higher level of
currency commodities could never be imported from
countries where they were before at the same price, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
where they required the same quantity of labour to produce
them. Your case is an impossible one, first because
you suppose the profits in two countries to be the same
although the cost of producing necessaries in one of them
be only one half of what it is in the other, secondly you
assume as a matter of course that with a free trade the
price of corn in the exporting country would rise to the
price of corn in the importing country whereas it would
fall in the importing country to the price in the exporting
country if its cost of production was not increased in that
country, and if it rose it would rise only in proportion to
the increased cost of production. When there is a free
trade between countries it is impossible that profits can
differ very much, the only cause of difference in such case
will be the different modes of living of the labourers; in
one country they may be contented with potatoes and a
mud hovel; in another they may require a decent house
and wheaten bread. You say: 'Proceeding from this
point it is obvious that in the course of a hundred years
(if accumulation were supposed) labour and corn might
continue at nearly the same price, while domestic commodities
from the fall of profits to the level of other
countries would fall to half their price estimated in the
money of the commercial world.' Domestic commodities
are to fall, because profits fall. If profits fall, <i>I</i> do not see
why domestic commodities should fall; but why should
profits fall if corn and labour continued at nearly the same
price? I know of no cause of the fall of profits but the
fall<a name="FNanchor_248_250" id="FNanchor_248_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_250" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> of labour. You say: 'A striking approximation
to this case actually exists in America.' 'The only difference,'
you continue, 'is that circumstances in America have
made labour high'; but this is the only important feature
in the case. I am however decidedly of opinion that, if
in America labour was very low and profits consequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
much higher than they are, there would be very little fall
in the domestic commodities of America.</p>

<p>I agree indeed with you that in the progress of the
cultivation of America her corn must rise with the increased
difficulty of producing it; this circumstance must
have a tendency to reduce the relative quantity, or rather
lower the level of American currency, which will not fail
by increasing the value of money to lower the value of
those commodities in America which are too bulky to be
exported<a name="FNanchor_249_251" id="FNanchor_249_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_251" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>. The commodities which America exports will
not be similarly affected. Nothing is to me so little important
as the fall and rise of commodities in money; the
great enquiries on which to fix our attention are the rise or
fall of corn, labour, and commodities, in real value, that is
to say the increase or diminution of the quantity of labour
necessary to raise corn and to manufacture commodities.
It may be curious to develop the effect of an alteration
of real value on money price; but mankind are only
really interested in making labour productive, in the enjoyment
of abundance, and in a good distribution of the
produce obtained by capital and industry. I cannot help
thinking that in your speculations you suppose these much
too closely connected with money price.</p>

<p>I have read a very good critique on Godwin in the
Edinburgh Review<a name="FNanchor_250_252" id="FNanchor_250_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_252" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>; and I am quite sure that I know the
writer. It is very well done and most satisfactorily exposes
Godwin's ignorance as well as his disingenuousness.</p>

<p>[Postscript.] I cannot agree with you that in the progress
of the cultivation of America a mean between her corn and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
labour will remain nearly at the same price as it now is,
estimated in money or in hogsheads of claret; it will in my
opinion rise. Let me take your own supposition. A
country produces her corn with half the labour of another
country; consequently she employs only half the capital in
producing a given quantity<a name="FNanchor_251_253" id="FNanchor_251_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_253" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>. In this country corn will be
at only half the price at which it is in another; 100 quarters
will sell for &pound;200, while in another it sells for &pound;400.
Suppose profits in both countries to be 20 per cent.; in
one a capital of &pound;166 will be employed in the raising of
100 quarters of corn, in the other &pound;333 will be so employed,
and 20 per cent. on each of these capitals will be on one
&pound;33, and on the other &pound;66. To get &pound;33 the one must
have 16&frac12; quarters for his share of the 100 quarters, the
other must have precisely the same quantity, and consequently
83&frac12; quarters are paid in both cases for wages and
other charges. But the farmer in the fertile country employs
only half the labour that the other employs, and consequently
with the same money wages each labourer will
have the command of double the quantity of corn, he will
have what you call double real wages.</p>

<p>Now suppose that in the progress of the fertile country
it [will] at last arrive at the state in which it is necessary
to [emplo]y &pound;333 instead of &pound;166 to raise 100 quarters of
corn; it is indeed possible, under the extravagant supposition
with which we have commenced, that labour might
continue at the same money price; but it is quite impossible
that corn should not be doubled in money price, for
twice the quantity of labourers at these uniform money
wages would be required to produce it. If corn doubles
in price and wages remain stationary, the mean between
the two must necessarily rise, and consequently, estimated
in claret or in money, a mean between her corn and labour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
cannot as you say remain nearly the same. If (as I had a
right to suppose) labour in such a country was at a low
money price, when corn could be produced with so much
facility, the conclusion, when corn rose, would be much
more in my favour.</p>

<p>I cannot allow that hats would fall in a progressive
country because of a fall of profits. How can it be said
that the cost of producing hats is reduced by a fall of
profits, if a fall of profits must be accompanied by a rise of
wages? Show me that a fall of profits may take place
without a rise of wages in any fixed measure of value, and
then I will yield this point. But <i>you</i> have no right to talk
of a fall of profits; your case is that of a progressive country
with low profits and enormous wages. If of every 100
quarters of corn, where it can be produced with little
labour, eighty-three be given to the labourers, while no
more is given in countries where double the quantity of
labourers are employed to produce 100 quarters of corn,
<i>you</i> are bound to say that wages are enormously high. In
my measure of value they would not be enormously high:
but the commodity on which wages were expended would
be extravagantly low; at any rate we should both agree that
profits in such a state of things would be very moderate.</p>

<p>It is hardly fair to tax you with so long a letter and so
soon too!</p>

<p class="idt">It is certainly probable that the fault is with me
in not understanding the proposition you submit to me;
and it may arise as you say from my being too much prepossessed
in favour of my own views; but I do not plead
guilty to the charge of not giving the requisite degree of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
attention to the propositions themselves. You now say
'where have I made the supposition you impute to me?
Surely not in my last letter. My first supposition was
that profits would be 100 per cent. in the country where
corn was obtained with double the facility, while it was
10 per cent. in all others.' If you had done so, then indeed
I should be justly chargeable with inattention; but these
were your words in the letter which I was answering, 'I
will try an illustration. Suppose that corn, money and
commodities were obtained in the great mass of nations,
connected with each other by commerce, at a rate of 10
per cent., but that in one country half the quantity of
labour only was necessary to produce corn, while other
commodities were produced with as much labour as in the
rest of the world;' not one word is said of profits being
at a different rate in this country; and, as you had said
that in the great mass of nations profits were at 10 per
cent., I concluded that in this country also profits were supposed
to be at 10 per cent. In this instance then you must
acknowledge the fault was yours and not mine. You do indeed
afterwards suppose that this single country exports
its corn and obtains the high price of other countries for it,
and by such means raises its profits to 100 per cent.; but
this evidently would depend on the fact whether she would
get the price of other countries or whether domestic competition
would lower the price of corn, in the countries to
which it was exported, to the growing price of the exporting
country. This I now understand to be your case. If
the country which raised its corn, with such great facility,
were completely insulated from all other countries, you
would probably allow that corn, in that country, would be
cheap in proportion to the facility of producing it. You
would allow this also if all other countries were determined
to protect their own agriculture and absolutely refused to
import foreign corn. But in the case of a free trade, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
you think the price would rise in the exporting country to
the level of the price of other countries, and consequently
profits would be enormously high. If I could admit the
fact of a high price, which I cannot do, I should adopt your
conclusion. I should say that general profits would be
higher than they had been before the rise in the price of
corn. Rents would undoubtedly be higher, for the landlord
would have at least the same portion of corn as before,
and that portion would be greatly enhanced in value.
Labour would be higher, because the labourer would require
higher money wages when corn was doubled in price.
And profits would be higher because the capitalist would
have more corn than before at the same time that it bore a
higher price. All these classes would be benefited by the
high relative value of corn to manufactured commodities,
and the capitalist more particularly so, because amongst
those manufactured commodities are to be found some of
the necessaries of the labourer, and therefore by the payment
of a less portion of corn to the labourer he would still
have the command of a increased quantity of food and necessaries
for himself and his family. The question then
between us is&mdash;would the price of corn rise permanently or
would it not, in the country which continued to possess the
great facility of producing it?</p>

<p>There is only one case in which I think such a rise possible,
and that is on the supposition that the whole capital
of the country was employed in producing corn, and yet
could not produce it in sufficient quantity to satisfy the
demand of other countries. In that case corn would be at
a monopoly price, in the same manner as those rare wines
which can only be produced in particular districts are at a
monopoly price, because competition could not have its full
effect. In the article of corn it would be limited by the
scarcity of capital, which gave to the growers of corn large
profits, in the same way as the East India Company or any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
other Company might make large profits. In the article
of wine the price would be augmented by the scarcity of
the land on which the grapes were grown, and would chiefly
go to the landlord in [the] form of rent. But, supposing no
monopoly, supposing capital to be so abundant that all the
corn demanded could be supplied, then I hold it to be demonstrable
that the price would sink to the growing price
of it in the exporting country.</p>

<p>There is however another point on which we differ; you
say a striking approximation to this actually exists in the
case of America; the only difference is that the demand
for labour has awarded a larger quantity of corn to the
labourer, the effect of which has been to keep the rate of
profit comparatively low. But you surely do not mean
that the exchangeable value of the commodities exported
by America are (<i>sic</i>) in the least degree affected by the
quantity of corn awarded to the labourer. I do not think
you are justified in your expectation that in consequence
of the accumulation of capital in America any commodity
should fall there until it ceased to possess the character of
a monopolized commodity. Corn and the bulky commodities
of America (which latter are always regulated by the
price of corn) could not fall until corn was sold at a price
depending on the quantity of labour actually expended on
its production, and not on the demand of our countries.
When that time came, it would cease to be a monopolized
commodity, and would fall as well as profits to the fair
competition rates. I deny that America comes at all within
your supposed case; and the proof is that, if you were to
isolate America from all other countries, you would not
lower her rate of profits, otherwise than by preventing her
from receiving a supply of labour from other countries;
but do the same thing to a country circumstanced as you
have supposed, and profits would immediately fall from
100 to perhaps 20 per cent. Your case in fact is that of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
country possessed of a particular commodity in very general
demand, and on which competition operates most feebly.
We have often discussed this peculiar case, and have
always agreed in our opinions on it. I confess, however,
I am astonished to hear you say that this is the case of
America; you might with as much reason contend that it
was also the case of Russia, of Poland, of the Cape of Good
Hope, of Botany Bay. If indeed America could send her
produce from the interior to Europe without expense, and
if the ports of all countries were open freely to receive the
corn with which America could, under the circumstances I
have supposed, supply [them], then I should say the cases
were similar; but, with the enormous expenses of sending
corn from the interior of the country, America can really
produce a very inconsiderable supply to Europe at an expense
much less than Europe can grow it. You ask what
can entitle me to suppose that corn will be at half the price
in America that it is in other countries, and then argue
on that supposition so contrary to the fact. I answer I
did not apply my argument to America but to your case,
which supposed a country to produce corn with half the
labour which was required to produce it in other countries.
If America can do this, then I apply it to America. You
complain that I do not reason fairly with you, that my
theory requires labour to be low in America; but you dispute
my theory and refer to the actual state of things in
America, where labour is high, and yet I contend that I
have a right to suppose labour low. I was dealing with
your case and not with America. With respect to America
I am not in possession of the facts of her case, and I cannot
admit that my theory requires the price of labour to be low
in that country. It requires rent to be low, for without
that there cannot be a great surplus produce to divide between
the two other classes, after satisfying the landlord.
You will always make me say that profits depend on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
low price of corn. I never do say so; I contend that they
depend on wages, and, although in my opinion wages will
be mainly regulated by the facility of obtaining necessaries,
they do not entirely depend on such facility. You wish to
confine me to that theory, but I reject it; it is none of mine,
and I have often told you so. I think I <i>do</i> show that your
fact does not invalidate my theory, which you say I am
bound to do, and I do not assume a different fact than the
one you refer to in order to refute you. Surely it is fair
to say 'for such and such reasons your conclusion is not
correct, but my argument would have been still stronger
against you, if, as I have a right to suppose, labour in such a
country were cheap, because the necessaries of the labourer
are there obtained with facility.' In a country situated
as you suppose America to be I do not see what is to make
her corn rise; it is already according to your arguments
at a monopoly price and cannot rise above that price
unless there should be a greater demand and a higher price
in Europe, which you say regulates the price in America,
or unless America should become so populous that the
price of her corn should be regulated by the expense of
growing it, as in other countries, and that expense should
exceed the present expense in Europe. If your theory be
correct, this may not happen in 150 years, notwithstanding
the greatest accumulation of capital; but will not labour
fall during all that time? If it does fall, then the mean
between corn and labour will fall. But suppose the other
case. Suppose the <i>cost</i> price of corn in America should rise
above the present cost price in Europe; is it conceivable
that labour should fall under such circumstances? To me
it appears impossible unless we suppose money to alter in
value. In this case then also the mean between corn and
labour would vary in value. If hats were produced under
the same circumstances as money they would not fall in
price in consequence of a fall of profits. If hats were pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>duced
by the employment of capital, and money were produced,
as you suppose, without any capital, then I allow and
have said so in my book<a name="FNanchor_253_255" id="FNanchor_253_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_255" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>, hats would fall in price with a
fall of profits. But I say again that too much importance
is attached to money; facility of production is the great
and interesting point. How does that operate on the interests
of mankind? You ask what is to become of the
money before produced in a country which should grow its
own corn with 10 per cent. profit, if it had its facility of
producing corn doubled, and profit, were to rise to 100 per
cent.; you ask further whether she would not continue to
produce money as well as other commodities as the profits
of producing it would be also 100 per cent. If the facility
of producing corn were doubled, a great deal of labour
would be employed on other things, and therefore the corn
and commodities of the country would altogether be of
as great a money value as before, and would require the
same quantity of money to circulate them. With respect
to the production of more money that would depend on the
demand for it and the prices of other things. I think the
production of money would continue as before, but it is
quite possible that there might be less encouragement to
produce money than other things, and therefore capital
might afford 100 per cent. profit in all employments except
that one. I wonder you should refuse to assent to this obvious
conclusion. You say it is your opinion that, if labour
were to fall in consequence of improvements in agriculture
before an increase of population had taken place, it could
only be from glut and want of demand. Is this opinion
consistent with another, which I think you hold, and in
which I agree, that one of the regulators of the price of
labour is the price of the necessaries of the labourer?</p>

<p>I have mentioned my suspicions respecting the writer of
the article on population in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> to several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
persons. I will not utter them from this time. I hear
nothing about Murray and Place. I hope your visit at
Holland House was an agreeable one. Mrs. Ricardo unites
with me in kind regards to Mrs. Malthus; we are all well
and are leading gay lives, one week at Worcester Music
meeting and Bromesberrow, another at Bath, etc.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Francis Place, the radical tailor, is well known to every
reader of Prof. Bain's Life of Mill (see e.g. p. 77). His book
on Population, perhaps the best of the long series that followed
the 'Essay' of Malthus, was published by Longman early in 1822.
He differed from Malthus mainly on the nature of the preventive
checks. The collection of Scrap Books known by his name in the
British Museum library contains the following autograph letter of
Malthus (whom he seems to have first known through Ricardo):&mdash;'Mr.
Malthus sends to Mr. Place, at the request of Mr. Ricardo,
the edition of the Essay on Population which was first published
in reply to the speculations of Mr. Godwin and other writers.
The copy sent is the only one which Mr. Malthus has left. He
will be much obliged to Mr. Place, therefore, as soon as he has
done with it, to send it to Mr. Ricardo's house in Upper Brook
St., to be kept till Mr. M. is in town, which will be in a fortnight.
Mr. Godwin, in his last work, has proceeded to the discussion of
the principles of population with a degree of ignorance of his
subject which is really quite inconceivable.' E. I. Coll. Feb. 19,
1821.</p></div>

satisfied with it, as it is accompanied with a pretty compliment
to me&mdash;indeed as pretty an one as could well be
paid to a person who is so uniformly your adversary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>

<p>I am sorry that I shall be obliged to miss two of the
Political Economy meetings<a name="FNanchor_255_257" id="FNanchor_255_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_257" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>, as I shall not be in London
till towards the latter end of the month of January.</p>

<p>On the 7th of December I am to dine at Hereford, by
invitation, with Hume, at a public dinner, which is to be
given to him for the purpose of presenting him a silver
tankard and a hogshead of cider, in token of the respect
and gratitude of the inhabitants of Hereford for his public
services. Hume comes from town on the occasion, and is to
be met at Ross at 11 o'clock in the forenoon, and escorted
with due honour into Hereford. I hope everything will be
conducted in an orderly and peaceable manner. I have
a great aversion to a row.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This wide gap of more than a year between the eighty-first
and the eighty-second letter of this collection may be filled up
by a letter to Say (&#338;uvres Diverses, p. 423), dated from London,
5th March, 1822, and being a somewhat tardy answer to Say's letter
of July, 1821, quoted above, p. 182. He says in effect: We
are nearer agreement than I thought, and your distinction of
natural and costly utility illustrated by the iron and the gold is
objectionable only in point of expression. But it follows that commodities
have a value equal to the quantity of labour spent on them,
and that therefore if a pound of gold for example could be produced
with less labour it would fall in value. You for your part therefore
are bound to maintain it would be a less portion of our [social]
wealth. Whereas for my part I do not estimate wealth by value,
but by utility from whatever source derived. Your 'Cat&eacute;chisme'
(of which Francis Place has just given me the 2nd edition) says
that a man's wealth is in proportion to the value and not to the
quantity of the things he possesses, but, as you add that that same
value is estimated by the quantity of other things these same
things will buy, wealth turns out to be in proportion to quantity
of goods after all. If wealth is value, then to lessen all costs, so
as to produce all things with less labour, would be to make the
wealth of the world no greater. After some remarks on the 'two
loaves,' he concludes by saying that the Political Economy Club
had made Say an honorary member. 'We hope in time to raise
ourselves from a Club to the dignity of an Academy, and become
a learned body with ever-increasing numbers.'</p>

<p>Say replies (1st May, 1822) that he gratefully accepts the
honorary membership. As to the points discussed, some of their
differences are merely verbal. His most important contention is
that in production we exchange productive services for products,
and the more products we obtain for them the more <i>value</i> they
have, and the richer we are. 'Moreover, I do not think that
we should aim at giving abstract definitions especially of wealth,&mdash;definitions,
that is to say, in which we should abstract from
the possessor and the thing possessed. This was the method of
medieval disputants, and this was the very reason they could
never come to an understanding. Too general a definition, which
enters into none of the peculiarities of each several object, teaches
us nothing.'</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>
<p>He concludes his letter by lamenting that his countrymen paid
so little attention to economical questions. A full half of his
audience in the Conservatoire des Arts et M&eacute;tiers consisted of
foreigners&mdash;English, Russians, Poles, Germans, Spaniards, Portuguese,
and Greeks. The Crown Prince of Denmark got private
lessons from him.</p></div>

<p class="idt">A long time has elapsed since there has been any
connection between us, and I take an early opportunity
after my arrival in England to address a few lines to you
principally with a view of having some account of yourself
and family, from your own pen. I have been actively employed
since we last met, for not only have I wandered
about Switzerland but I have been as far as Florence. In
my way to Florence I deviated from the direct road to see
Venice, and on my return from it I did the same thing in
order to visit Genoa. Our journey has been an uncommonly
prosperous one, for we have all enjoyed perfect
health and have met with few or no difficulties. My companions
as well as myself have very much enjoyed this
tour. When I was at Geneva I saw a good deal of our
friend Dumont, who accompanied us to Chamouny and
returned with us to Geneva. At Coppet<a name="FNanchor_258_260" id="FNanchor_258_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_260" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> I met M. Sis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>mondi.
He, the Duke of Broglie, and I had a long conversation
on the points of difference between us: the Duke
took my side, but after a long battle we each of us I believe
remained in the same opinion that we commenced the discussion
in. M. Sismondi has left a pleasing impression on
my mind. Madame de Broglie had a great deal of patience
and forbearance. She is, I think, a very agreeable lady.
I stayed in Paris three weeks just previous to my return
to England. M. de Broglie and the Baron de Stael arrived
there after me. I had the pleasure of seeing them two or
three times. I was very much pleased with M. Gallois<a name="FNanchor_259_261" id="FNanchor_259_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_261" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>, who
made me acquainted with M. Destutt [de] Tracy<a name="FNanchor_260_262" id="FNanchor_260_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_262" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>, a very
agreeable old gentleman, whose works I had read with
pleasure. I do not entirely agree with him in his political
economy; he is one of Say's school; there are, nevertheless,
some points of difference between them. I saw Say several
times, but our conversation did not turn much on subjects
connected with political economy; he never led to those
subjects, and I always fancied he did not much like to talk
upon them. His brother, Louis Say<a name="FNanchor_261_263" id="FNanchor_261_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_263" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>, has published a thick
volume of remarks upon Adam Smith's, his brother's, your,
and my opinions. He is not satisfied with any of us. His
principal object is to show that wealth consists in the
abundance of enjoyable commodities; he accuses us all of
wishing to keep up what we call valuable commodities,
without any regard to quantity, about which only the
political economist should be anxious. I do not believe
that any of us will plead guilty to this charge. I feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
fully assured that I do not merit it should be made
against me.</p>

<p>M. Gamier<a name="FNanchor_262_264" id="FNanchor_262_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_264" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> is dead; but previous to his death he had
prepared an additional volume of notes for a new edition of
his translation of the 'Wealth of Nations,' and which [<i>sic</i>]
has lately been published. I had an opportunity of looking
it over, and naturally turned to those places where he criticises
me. He has bestowed a good deal of space on his
remarks upon my work, but they do appear to me quite
irrelevant. Neither he nor M. Say have (<i>sic</i>) succeeded in
at all understanding what my opinions are. Your name
often occurs in this last volume. I believe he differed from
you also, but I had not time to read the whole of his book.</p>

<p>I hope you have been very industrious in my absence,
and that we shall soon see the new edition of your last
work<a name="FNanchor_263_265" id="FNanchor_263_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_265" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>. I am anxious to know how you deal with the
difficult question of value. I shall read you with great
interest and attention.</p>

<p>I am sorry to find the agricultural distress continue. I
was in hopes that it would have subsided before this time.
I suppose we shall hear much on this subject next session
of Parliament, and that I shall be a mark for all the
country gentlemen. There is not an opinion I have given
on the subject which I desire to recall. I only regret that
my adversaries do not do me justice, and that they put
sentiments in my mouth which I never uttered. Dr.
Copplestone in his article in the Quarterly Review<a name="FNanchor_264_266" id="FNanchor_264_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_266" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> charges
me with maintaining the absurd doctrine that the price of
gold bullion is a sure test of the value of bullion and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
currency. A Mr. Paget has addressed a (printed) letter<a name="FNanchor_265_267" id="FNanchor_265_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_267" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
to me, in which I am accused of holding the same opinion,
and everybody knows how pertinaciously Cobbet[t] persists
in saying that I have always done so. I must fight
my cause as well as I can; I know it is an honest one (in
spite of Mr. Western's<a name="FNanchor_266_268" id="FNanchor_266_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_268" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> insinuations), and, if it be also
founded in truth and on correct views, justice will be
finally done to me.</p>

<p>I arrived in London the beginning of last week; I saw
Tooke for a few minutes, and was glad to hear from him
that he had been writing and was nearly ready for the
press. I have a very good opinion of his judgment and of
the soundness of his views; he will, I think, from his
practical knowledge, throw much light on the question of
the influence of an over-supply or of an increased demand,
without a corresponding supply, on price<a name="FNanchor_267_269" id="FNanchor_267_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_269" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>.</p>

<p>I am now on a visit to my son. On the 27th I shall go
to Gatcomb for a week. From the 3rd to the 17th January
I shall be with Mrs. Austin at Bradley, Wottonunderedge,
and from the 17th to the 2nd February with Mrs. Clutterbuck,
Widcomb, Bath. Where shall you pass your holidays?
Is there any probability of my seeing you at Bath?
I should be glad to meet you there.</p>

<p>I read in the papers with much concern of the renewal
of disturbances amongst the young men at the college. I
know how distressing to you such insubordination is, and
greatly regretted that you should have been again exposed
to it. I hope that order was quickly restored.</p>

<p>I saw Mr. Whishaw in London for a few minutes. I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>

<span class="smcap">My dear Malthus</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">After the most attentive consideration which I can
give to your book<a name="FNanchor_268_270" id="FNanchor_268_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_270" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>, I cannot agree with you in considering
labour, in the sense in which you use it, as a good measure
of value. Neither can I discover exactly what connexion
the constant labour necessary to produce the wages and
profits on a commodity has with its value. If it be a good
measure for one commodity, it must be for all commodities;
and, as well as valuing wheat by the constant quantity of
labour necessary to produce the particular quantity given
to the workman, together with the profit of the farmer on
that particular quantity, I might value cloth or any other
thing by the same rule.</p>

<p>I know, indeed, that I might make out a table<a name="FNanchor_269_271" id="FNanchor_269_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_271" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> precisely
such as yours, in which the only alteration would be the
word cloth instead of the word wheat, and you would
probably then ask me whether your principle were not of
universal application. I should answer that it contains in
it that radical objection which you make against the proposed
measure of your opponents. You may, if you please,
arbitrarily select labour as a measure of value, and explain
all the science of political economy by it, in the same way
as any other man might select gold or any other com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>modity;
but you can no more connect it with a principle
or show its invariability than he could. Let me suppose
that cloth could not be made in less than two years; the
first line of my table must be altered, and the figures would
stand in the following order:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
150, 100, 25 per cent. 7&frac12;, 2&frac12;, 10, 10, 15.<br />
</p>

<p>They would do so because ten pieces of cloth would, with
the accumulation of profit for two years, be of the same
value as a commodity, the result of the same quantity of
labour, which could be produced in two years. I do not
know how you will treat this objection, but in my opinion
it is fatal to your whole theory.</p>

<p>I have the same objection to your measure, which I have
always professed; you choose<a name="FNanchor_270_272" id="FNanchor_270_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_272" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> a variable measure for an
invariable standard. Who can say that a plague which
should take off half our people would not alter the value of
labour?  We might, indeed, agree to transfer the variation to
the commodities, and to say that they had fallen and not that
labour had risen, but I can see no advantage in the change.</p>

<p>We might again discover modes by which the necessaries
of the labourer might be produced with uncommon facility;
and, in consequence of the stimulus which the good situation
of the labourers might give to population, the reward
of the labour in necessaries might be no higher than before;
would it be right in this case, in which nothing had really
altered but necessaries and labour, to say that they only
had remained steadily at the same value, and, because a
given quantity of corn or of labour will exchange only for
(perhaps) 3/4 of the former quantity of linen, cloth, or
money, to declare that it was the linen, cloth, or money
which had risen in value, not labour and corn which
had fallen?</p>

<p>Two countries are equally skilful and industrious; but
in one the people live on the cheap food of potatoes, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
other on the dear food, wheat. You will allow that profits
will be higher in the one country than the other. You
will allow, too, that money may be nearly of the same value
in both, if we choose anything else as a measure of value
but labour. You will further agree that there might be an
extensive trade between such countries. If a man sent a
pipe of wine from the potato<a name="FNanchor_271_273" id="FNanchor_271_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_273" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> country, which cost &pound;100
and which might be sold at &pound;110 in the wheat country,
you would say that the wine was at a higher value in the
country from which it was exported, merely because, in
that country, it could command more labour. You would
say this although the wine would not only exchange for
more money but for more of every other commodity in the
wheat country. I contend that this is a novelty which
cannot be considered an improvement; it would confound
all our usual notions, and would impose upon us the necessity
of learning a new language. All mankind would say
that wine was dearer in the wheat than in the potato
country, and that labour was of less value in the latter.
In page 31 there is a long passage on the reason for
choosing labour as a standard, with which I am not
satisfied. A piece of cloth is 120 yards in length and
is to be divided between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>; it is obvious that in
proportion as much is given to <i>A</i> less will be given to <i>B</i>
and vice versa. This will be true, although the value of
the whole 120 yards be &pound;100, &pound;50, or &pound;5. Is it not then
a begging of the question to assume the constant value
because the quantity is constant, and because it is always
to be divided between two persons?</p>

<p>Allowing you your premises, I see very few instances in
which I can quarrel with your conclusions. I agree with
all you say concerning the glut of commodities; allow
to you your measure, and it is impossible to differ in the
result.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<h3>LXXXIV.</h3>

<p class="ralign1">
<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>28 May, 1823</i>.</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Malthus</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">I will, to the best of my power, state my objections
to your arguments respecting the measure of value. You
have yourself stated, as an objection to my view on this
subject, that a commodity produced with labour and capital
united, cannot be a measure of value for any other commodities
than such as are produced precisely under the
same circumstances, and in this I have agreed that you
are substantially correct. If all commodities were produced
in one day and by labour only without the assistance
of capital, they would vary in proportion as the
quantity of labour employed on their production increased
or diminished. If the same quantity of labour was constantly
employed on the production of money, money
would be an accurate measure of absolute value, and, if
shrimps or nuts or any other thing rose or fell in such
money, it would only be because more or less labour was
employed in procuring them. Under such circumstances
every commodity which was the produce of a day's labour
would naturally command a day's labour, and therefore
the value of a commodity would be in proportion to the
quantity of labour which it would command. But, though
such a money would measure accurately the value of every
commodity produced under circumstances exactly similar,
it would not be an accurate measure of the value of other
commodities produced with a large quantity of capital,
employed for a length of time. In the case just supposed
a quantity of shrimps would be as accurate a measure of
value as a quantity of money produced by the same
quantity of labour; but, when capital is employed and
cloth is the product of labour and capital, you justly say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
that cloth is not a correct measure of the value of shrimps
and of silver, picked up by labour alone, on the sea shore;
and yet with singular inconsistency, as I cannot help
thinking, you contend that the shrimps and the silver,
picked up by labour alone on the sea shore, are accurate
measures of the value of cloth. If you are right, then
must cloth be also an accurate measure of value, because
the thing measured must be as good a measure as the thing
with which you measure. When I say that &pound;4 and a
quarter of wheat are of the same value, I can measure
other values by the quarter of wheat as well as by the &pound;4.
You say: 'It is conceded that, when labour alone is concerned
in the production of commodities, and there is no
question of time, both the absolute and exchangeable
values of such commodities may be accurately measured
by the quantity of labour employed upon them.' Nothing
can, I think, be more correct, and it is perfectly accordant
with what I have been saying. Your mistake appears to
me to be this: you show us that under certain conditions
a certain commodity would be a measure of absolute value,
and then you apply it to cases where the conditions are not
complied with, and suppose it to be a measure of absolute
value in those cases also. You appear to me, too, to deceive
yourself when you think you prove your proposition,
because your proof only amounts to this, that your
measure is a good measure of exchangeable value but
not of absolute value. You say: 'If the accumulated and
immediate labour worked up in a commodity be of any
assumed value, &pound;100 for instance, and the profits of the
value of &pound;20, including the compound profits upon the
labour worked up in the materials, the whole will be of the
value of &pound;120. Of this value 1/6 only belongs to profits,
the rest or 5/6 may be considered as the product of pure
labour.' This is quite true, whether we value the commodity
by the quantity of labour actually employed upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
it, by the quantity which it will command when brought
to market, or by the quantity of money, or any other commodity,
for which it is exchanged; 5/6, in all cases, will
belong to the workmen and 1/6 to the master. 'Consequently
the value of 5/6 of the produce is determined by the
quantity of labour employed on the whole; and the value
of the whole produce by the quantity of labour employed
upon it with the addition of 1/6 of that quantity.' This is
really saying no more than that, when profits are one sixth
of the value of the whole commodity (in which no rent
enters), the other 5/6 go to reward the labourers, and that
the portion so going to the labourers may itself be resolved
into labour and profits in the same proportion of 5 and 1.
Five men produce six pieces of cloth, of which 5 are paid
to them, the men; if profits fall one half, the men will
receive 5&frac12; pieces, and then you say the cloth is of less
value; but in what medium? In labour, you answer.
You appear to me to advance a proposition that cloth is
of less value when it will exchange for less labour, and to
prove it by showing the fact, merely, that it actually does
exchange for less labour.</p>

<p>You say: 'But, when labour is concerned, it follows from
what has been conceded that the value of the produce is
determined by the quantity of labour employed upon it.'
By value here you mean absolute value; and then you
immediately apply this measure of absolute value, which
is only conceded in a particular case, to a general proposition,
and say 'consequently;' consequently on what? On
this particular case; 'consequently the value of 5/6 of the
produce is determined by the quantity of labour employed
on the whole,' that is to say 'consequently the quantity of
labour which 5/6 of the produce will command is determined
by the quantity of labour employed on the whole;' the
same is true, in the same sense, of 5/6, 5/7, 5/8, 5/9 or of any other
proportions in which the whole may be divided. My only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
object has been to show, and, if I am not mistaken, I have
succeeded in showing, that a measure of value, which is
only allowed to be accurate in a particular case where no
capital is employed, is arbitrarily applied by you to cases
where capital and time necessarily enter into the consideration.</p>

<p>I fear I have been guilty of many repetitions. I shall
not regret it, however, if I have made myself understood.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;On 12th June, 1822, in one of Ricardo's most important
speeches on Resumption (afterwards published as a pamphlet), he
speaks of those who propose to make Corn, on a ten years' average,
the standard of value instead of money. To prove gold more
variable than corn, they and their authorities, Locke and Adam
Smith are (he says) obliged to begin by supposing gold invariable.
'Unless the medium in which the price of corn is estimated could be
asserted to be invariable in its value, how could corn be said not
to have varied in relative value? If they must admit the medium
to be variable&mdash;and who could deny it?&mdash;then what became of
the argument?' Nothing is more difficult than to ascertain the
variations in the value of money: 'To do so with any accuracy we
should have an invariable measure of value; but such a measure
we never had nor ever can have.' (Cf. Pol. Econ. and Tax. ch. i. &sect; 7,
Works, p. 28.) But we can speak with accuracy of depreciation;
we can see to it that the standard is always the same standard, and
that our currency conforms to it, even if the standard itself may
vary in value. (See Note to Letter XXXI.)</p></div>

<p class="ralign1">
<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>13 July, 1823</i>.</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Malthus</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">M<sup>c</sup>Culloch and I did not settle the question of value
before we parted,&mdash;it is too difficult a one to settle in a
conversation; I heard everything he had to urge in favour
of his view, and promised, during my holiday, to bestow a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
good deal of consideration on it. He means exactly what
you say;&mdash;he does not contend that commodities exchange
for each other according to the quantity of labour actually
worked up in them, but he constitutes a commodity the
general measure, by which he estimates the value of all
others. A pipe of wine kept for three years has no more
labour worked up in it than a pipe of wine kept for a day,
but he says the additional value on account of time must
be estimated by the accumulations which a like amount of
capital actively employed in the support of labour would
make in the same time. An oak-tree which has been
growing for 200 years has very little labour actually
worked up in it, but its value is to be estimated by the
accumulated capital which the original labour employed
would give in the same time. He and you in fact differ as
to your original measure. I think he could not give any
other good reason for choosing a medium which requires
labour and capital to produce it, rather than one which
requires labour only, excepting that commodities in general
require the combination of the two, and that a measure, to
have any claim to be even an approximation to an accurate
one, should itself be produced under circumstances somewhat
similar to the commodities which it is to measure.
If all things required precisely the same quantities of
capital and labour, and for the same length of time, to
produce them, any one of them would be an accurate
measure of the rest; but this is not the case; the conditions
admit of infinite variety, and therefore whichever
we choose it can only be an approximation to truth, and
we are bound to give good reasons for preferring it.</p>

<p>I should, indeed, be wanting in candour if I refused to
admit that my money measure would not measure the
quantity of labour worked up in commodities. I have
admitted it over and over again. I am also ready to
admit that your money measure will measure exactly the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
quantity of labour and profits together of which commodities
are composed, but so will my money measure.
Neither of them will measure the quantity of labour alone
worked up in commodities, but they will both measure the
quantity of labour and profits together of which commodities
are composed. Suppose gold always to require
the same quantity of labour, for one year, before it can be
brought to market, will you say that all variations in
wages and profits may not be estimated in this medium?
You would indeed say that many of those variations would
be ascribable to the variations in the value of the medium,
and not to any alteration in the value of the thing
measured, because you do not think that it is any proof
of invariability in a commodity that it requires always the
same quantity of labour, and the same duration of time to
produce it. If I allow the justice of your objection, I am
at liberty to apply the same to your medium. The same
quantity of labour applied for a day will always produce the
same given quantity of gold; gold is therefore an invariable
measure, you say. I find this gold vary in relation to
another commodity which always requires the same
quantity of labour and capital to produce it; you say it
is never the gold but it is always the commodity which
varies, and, when you are asked why, you answer because
labour never varies. Double the quantity of labour in a
country or diminish it one half, always leaving the funds
which are to employ it at precisely the same amount, and
you tell us, notwithstanding the condition of the labourer
is in the one case a very distressed one, in the other a very
prosperous one, that the value of his labour has not varied.
I cannot subscribe to the justness of this language. The
question is whether you are right, not whether I am wrong.
Suppose that a man in India could pick up in a day
precisely the same quantity of gold as in England, and that
all trade in provisions were forbid between the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
countries. The small quantity of rice and clothing in
India which are necessary for the support of a labourer
would be of precisely the same value as the quantity of
wheat and clothing necessary for a labourer in England.
But this would not long continue. All manufactured
commodities would be of a high comparative money value
in India, and consequently we should export manufactured
commodities and import gold; the reward of a labourer in
England would come to be a much larger quantity of gold
than he could actually pick up here. No gold would be
then obtained in England but by means of importation.
Under these circumstances you would say that money was
of a low value in England, and you would be correct if all
men agreed to constitute labour the measure of value; but
in this they do not agree, and, as we should find that at the
very moment that gold was low, relatively to labour, in
England, it was high relatively to manufactured commodities
of every description, with which in fact gold
would be purchased from India, if we took these commodities
for the measure, we should be bound to say that
gold was cheap in England and dear in India. You must
remember that the point in dispute is whether labour be
the correct measure of value; you must not then take the
fact for granted, and then offer it as a proof of your correct
conclusion.</p>

not necessary that it should possess the property of determining
what proportion of the value of the commodity
measured belongs to wages, and what proportion belongs
to profits. You make it a reproach on my proposed measure
that it will not do this, and prefer your own because
it will. Now, as I do not think this quality essential to
a measure of value, I shall not defend mine for not
possessing this quality. This consideration appears to me
wholly foreign to the question under discussion.</p>

<p>We agree, I believe, that nothing can be a measure of
value which does not itself possess value. We agree too,
I believe, that a measure of value to be a good one should
itself be invariable, and further that in selecting one thing
as a measure of value rather than another we are bound to
show some good reason for such selection, for, if a good
reason be not given, the choice is altogether arbitrary.
Now the measure proposed by you has value, and therefore
[is] not to be objected against on account of any deficiency of
that quality; but I do not think it is invariable, and by the
concession which you make in your last letter you appear
to give up your measure, for you say that 'you expressed
yourself without sufficient care, when you intimated that,
if any number of labourers were imported or exported, the
value of labour would remain the same.' This is a large
concession indeed, and I think entirely subverts your measure,
because, if it be true of labourers exported or imported,
it must be true also of labourers born or dying in
the country. If by poor laws imprudent marriages are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
encouraged and population becomes excessive, the effect on
the value of labour will be precisely the same as if labourers
had been imported; and, if an epidemic disorder break out
and many labourers die, it will be the same as if they were
exported. Nay more, if the people be well educated and
be taught caution and foresight with regard to the increase
of their numbers, who shall say that the effect on the value
of labour will not be the same as an exportation of
labourers? You have, I think, been imprudent, which
is much at variance with your usual practice, in conceding
this point, and you allow us to enter into your fortress and
spike all your guns. You add indeed: 'This will only be
true after the supply comes to be affected by the increased
or diminished number of labourers.' When will the supply
not be affected by the increased or diminished number?
What follows will not assist you, for you say: 'If the corn
obtained by twenty men be divided among ten, then the
value of the wages of ten men will be less than the quantity
of labour employed to produce them with the addition of
profits, and vice versa.' What profits? They might have
been 50 per cent., and may from the circumstance mentioned
be reduced to 5 per cent. You speak of profits in
this place as if they were a fixed amount, and forget that
they fall when wages rise. Besides, I will not admit the
extravagant supposition that the corn obtained by the
labour of twenty men is bestowed as wages on ten men;
but I will suppose that the corn obtained by twenty men
had been sufficient to command the labour of thirty men,
but that owing to a diminished supply of labour this same
quantity of corn obtained by the same number of men is
bestowed as wages on twenty-two men. In this case I ask
you whether corn has fallen in value in the proportion of
thirty to twenty-two? If you say Yes, then you do not
admit that labour may rise in value in consequence of
exporting labourers; and, if you say No, there is an end of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
your measure, because you then acknowledge that commodities
do not vary according to the quantity of labour they
can command. I do not see how you are to extricate yourself
from this dilemma. I cannot discover what the value of
the precious metals in different countries can have to do
with this question. A piece of cloth or a piece of muslin
can command more labour in India than in England; on
this we are agreed, but we are not agreed in our explanation
of this fact. You say the piece of cloth or muslin is more
valuable in India than in England, and your proof is that
it can command more labour in India. You would say so,
although both cloth and muslin were exported from India
to England, from the country where they are dear to the
country where they are cheap. I, on the contrary, say that
it is not the cloth and muslin which are dear in India and
cheap in England, but it is labour which is cheap in India
and dear in England, and that cloth and muslin would
come to England from India although there were no such
commodities as gold and silver on the face of the earth.
I say further that you are bound to admit this by the concession
which you have made, for you must admit that
labour might be rendered cheap as effectually in England
by prevailing on English labourers to be satisfied with the
modest remuneration of food paid in India, as by the
importation of labourers; and, if you do not admit it, I beg
to ask why you refuse to do so. I beg you to point out the
distinction between a supply of labourers from abroad, with
a consequently reduced remuneration of food, and a supply
of labourers from the principle of population, and a consequent
reduction in the remuneration paid in food. Can you
be said to have given a good reason for the selection which
you have made of a measure of value when it will not bear
close examination? You have repeatedly said that a commodity,
on which a quantity of labour has been bestowed,
will always exchange for a like quantity, together with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
an additional quantity which will constitute the profits on
the advances. Now this I consider to be your main proposition,
and on its truth must depend according to your own
view the correctness of your measure. Is it true then that
every commodity exchanges for two quantities of labour,
one equal to the quantity actually worked up in it, another
equal to the quantity which the profits will command?
I say it is not. This year corn is cheap, and I must give
a certain quantity of it to procure the labour of ten men to
be worked up in the commodity which I manufacture; but
next year, when I take my commodity to market, corn is
dear and wages high, and therefore to procure a certain
quantity of labour I must give more of my finished commodity
than I should have given if corn had been plenty [<i>sic</i>]
and wages low. If corn had been cheap and wages low,
my profits would have been high; as it is, they are low.
I want to know in these two cases whether the commodity
does really exchange for the two specific quantities of
labour mentioned above. You answer my question by
saying that you always make a reserve of the first quantity,
and all above it you call profits. But I contend that
labour of one value has been expended on the commodity,
and, when it comes to market, it is exchanged for labour of
another value, and that is the sole reason why the balance,
over and above the labour expended on it, is small. Why
is it small but because the value of labour is high? No
such thing, you say; labour never varies; and yet you cannot
but confess that, if corn had been abundant and if
wages had remained the same, the manufactured commodity
would have exchanged for a great deal more labour. You
say: 'How comes it about that labour should remain of the
same value in the progress of society, when it is known that
it must require more labour to produce it?' You must
mean 'to produce the remuneration paid for it;' and you
add: 'The answer to this question is that, as profits depend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
upon the <i>proportion</i> of the whole produce which goes to
labour, it must necessarily happen that the increase of value
occasioned by the additional quantity of labour will be
exactly counterbalanced by the diminution in the amount
of profits, leaving the value of labour the same.' I confess
I cannot understand this answer. We are inquiring about
the meaning which should be attached to the words 'increase
of value,' 'diminution of value.' You tell me that
increase of value means an increased power of commanding
labour. I deny that this definition is a correct one, because
I  deny the invariability of the standard measure you have
chosen; and to prove its invariability you speak of the
proportion in which the whole produce is divided, and that,
if wages have more, profits have less;&mdash;all which is true,
but what connection do you prove between this proposition
and the invariability in your measure of value? In your
answer you use the words 'increase of value;' that is to
explain the meaning of the words required to be understood
by the use of the words themselves. You mistake
M^cCulloch's and my objection to your doctrine if you
suppose it to be on account of its making the same quantity
of labour of the same value, while the condition of the
labourer is very different; we do not object to it on that
account, because, as you justly observe, our own doctrines
require the same admission; but we object to your saying
that, from whatever cause it may arise that the labourer's
condition is deteriorated, he is always receiving the same
value as wages. When <i>our</i> labourers are badly off,
although (we say) they have wages of the same value,
profits must necessarily be very low; according to you
wages would be of the same value whether profits were
2 per cent. or 50 per cent.</p>

<p>I think I have shown you that your long letter was
acceptable by doing that which is really a difficult task to

labouring in my vocation and trying to understand the

hitherto done is to convince myself more and more of the
extreme difficulty of finding an unobjectionable measure of
value. As far as I have yet been [able] to reflect upon
McCulloch's and Mill's suggestion, I am not satisfied
with it. They make the best defence for my measure<a name="FNanchor_273_275" id="FNanchor_273_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_275" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>, but

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Arguments very similar to those of this letter have been
used against Malthus by Julius Pierstorff, in his book on 'Die
Lehre vom Unternehmergewinn' (Berlin, 1875), where the views
of Malthus and Ricardo are compared with one another. There is,
however, shrewder criticism of Ricardo's whole doctrine in B&ouml;hm
Bawerk's 'Geschichte und Kritik der Kapital-Zins-Theorien,' Innsbr&uuml;ck,
1884. A neat <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the view, held more
or less explicitly by MacCulloch and others, that cost is enough to
explain value, is given by B&ouml;hm Bawerk in his 'Grundz&uuml;ge der
Theorie des wirthschaftlichen G&uuml;terwerths' (Jena, 1886, p. 72), in
a passage of which this is the conclusion: 'To explain the value

means of its production. But how have the latter their value?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>Logically we must answer from <i>their</i> cost, in other words from
the means of production a degree farther back, and so on backwards.
Now, clearly, if we pursue this regress, we either arrive
at commodities which are not themselves 'produced,' e.g. land and
labour, and our explanation of all value by cost has failed us; or
else we explain even these sophistically as being in a sense 'products,'
and owing their value to their cost, e.g. the labour as owing
its value to the cost of the labourer's subsistence, and in this case
we are bound to go farther back and explain the value of the
means of subsistence by <i>their</i> cost, i.e. the labour that produced
them; and we reason endlessly in a circle.'</p></div>

<span class="smcap">My dear Malthus</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="idt">It is a prudent step in you to withdraw your concession,
for I am sure that your theory could not stand
with it. You find fault with my measure of value, you
say, because it varies with the varying profits of other
commodities. This is, I acknowledge, an imperfection in
it when used to measure other commodities in which there
enters more or less of profits than enters into my measure;
but you do not appear to see that against your measure
the same objection holds good, for your measure contains
no profits at all, and therefore never can be an accurate
measure of value for commodities which do contain profits.
If I had no other arguments to offer against your measure,
this which I am going to mention <i>when used to you</i> would
be fatal to it. You say that my measure cannot measure
commodities produced by labour alone. Granted; but, if
it be true, how can your measure measure commodities
produced with labour and profits united? You might just
as well say that three times two are six and that twice
three are not six, or that a foot measure was a good mea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>sure
for a yard but a yard was not a good measure for a
foot. If your measure will measure my commodity accurately,
mine must do the same by yours. These are identical
propositions, and I confess I see no answer that can
be made to me. The fact really is that no accurate measure
of absolute value can be found. No one doubts the desirableness
of having one; but all we can ever hope to get is
one tolerably well calculated to measure the greatest number
of commodities, and therefore I should have no hesitation
in admitting your measure to be the best, under all
circumstances, if you could show that the greatest number
of commodities were produced by labour alone without the
intervention of capital. On the other hand, if a greater
number of commodities are produced under the circumstances
which I suppose to attend the production of the
commodity which I choose for my measure, then mine
would be the best measure. You will understand that in
either case I suppose a degree of arbitrariness in the selection,
and I only contend that it would be best employed in
selecting mine.</p>

<p>When you say that my great mistake is in considering
commodities made up of labour alone and not of labour and
profits, I think the error is yours, not mine, for that is precisely
what you do; you measure commodities by labour
alone, which have both labour and profits in them. You
surely will not say that my money, produced by labour
and capital, and by which I propose to measure other
things, omits profits. Yours does; what profits are there
in shrimps or in gold picked up by daily labour, on account
of the labourer, on the sea-shore? How much more
justly then might this accusation be brought against you!</p>

<p>You object to me that I am inconsistent in wishing to
leave the consideration of the value of money here and in
India out of the question, when speaking of the value of
labour and of commodities in this country and in India.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
I, you say, to leave out the consideration of the value of
the precious metals, who have proposed a measure formed
of them! There is nothing inconsistent in this. In examining
your proposition which rejects my measure and
adopts another, I must try it by your doctrines and not by
mine which you reject. A conclusion founded on my premises
might be a just one, but, if you dispute my premises
and substitute others, the conclusion may no longer be the
same; and in examining your doctrines I must attend only
to the conclusions to which your premises would lead me.
You ask: 'Would you really say that cloth and muslin
were not dear in India where they cost four or five times
as much labour as in England?' You know I would not,
because I estimate value by the quantity of labour worked
up in a commodity; but by the cost in labour of cloth and
muslin in India you do not mean the quantity of labour
actually employed on their production, but the quantity
which the finished commodity can command in exchange.
The difference between us is this; you say a commodity
is dear because it will command a great quantity of labour,
I say it is only dear when a great quantity has been bestowed
on its production. In India a commodity may be
produced with twenty days' labour, and may command
thirty days' labour. In England it may be produced by
twenty-five days' labour and command only twenty-nine.
According to you this commodity is dearer in India, according
to me it is dearer in England.</p>

<p>Now here is my objection against your measure as a
general measure of value, that, notwithstanding more labour
may be bestowed on a commodity, it may fall in value
estimated in your measure; it may exchange for a less
quantity of labour. This is impossible when you apply
your measure legitimately to those objects only which it is
calculated to measure. Would it be possible, for example,
to apply more labour to the production of shrimps or to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
pick up grains of gold on the sea-shore, and yet to sell
those commodities for less labour than before? Certainly
not; but it would be quite possible to bestow more labour
on the making of a piece of cloth, and yet for cloth to exchange
for a less quantity of labour than before. This is
another argument in my mind conclusive against the expediency
of adopting your measure.</p>

<p>I repeat once more that the same trade precisely would
go on between India and Europe, as far as regards commodities,
if no such thing as money made of gold and silver
existed in the world. All commodities would in that case
as well as now command a much larger quantity of labour
in India than in England; and, if we wanted to know how
much more, either of those commodities, as well as money,
would enable us to ascertain. The same thing which makes
money of a low value in England makes many other commodities
of a low value there; and the political economist
in accounting for the low value of one accounts at the same
time for the low value of the others. I do not object to
accounting for the low value of gold in particular countries;
but I say it is not material to an enquiry into a
general measure of value, particularly if it be itself objected
to as forming any element in that measure.</p>

<p>Suppose a farmer to have a certain quantity of cattle
and implements and a hundred quarters of wheat,&mdash;that
he expends this wheat in supporting a certain quantity of
labour, and that the result is 110 quarters of wheat
and an increase of one-tenth also in his cattle and implements;
would not his profits be 10 per cent. whatever
might be the price of labour the following year? If the
110 quarters could command no more labour than the 100
quarters could command before, he would, according to you,
have made no profits; and you are right if we admit that
yours is a correct measure of value; he would have a profit
in kind but no profit in value.  If wheat was the measure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
of value, he would have a profit in kind, and the same
profit in value. If money was the correct measure of value
and he commenced with &pound;100, he would have 10 per cent.
profit if the value of his produce was &pound;110. All these results
leave the question of a measure of value undecided,
and prove nothing but the convenience, in your estimation,
of adopting one in preference to another. The labourer,
however, who lived by his labour would find it difficult to
be persuaded that his labour was of the same value at two
periods, in one of which he had abundance of food and
clothing, and in another he was absolutely starving for
want. What he might think would certainly not affect
the philosophy of the question; but it would be at least as
good a reason against the measure you propose as that of
the farmer in favour of it, when he found that he had no
profits because he had no greater command of labour,
although he might have more corn or more money. You
call every increase of value nominal which is not an increase
in the measure you propose. I do not object to your
doing so; but those who do not agree with you in the propriety
of adopting this measure may argue very consistently
in saying they are possessed of more value when they have
&pound;110 than when they had &pound;100, although the larger sum
may not when it is realized command so much labour as
the smaller sum did before, because they not only admit
but contend that labour may rise and fall in value, and
therefore in respect to labour he may be poorer, although he
possesses a greater value.</p>

<p>I have said that the value of most commodities is made
up of labour and profits. If this be so, you observe, 'it is
as clear as the sun that the variable wages which command
the same quantity of labour must be of the same value, <i>because</i>
they will always cost in their production the same
quantity of labour with the addition of the profits upon
that labour.' I confess that I cannot see the connection of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
this conclusion with the premises. Whether you divide a
commodity in eight, seven, or six divisions, it will always
be divided into two portions, variable portions, but always
two. If the division be in eight, the portions may be six
and two, five and three, four and four, seven and one. If
seven, they may be six and one, five and two, four and
three, and so on. Now this is my admission. What we
want to know is what the number of those divisions are,
or what the value of the commodity is, whether eight, seven,
or six? And have I come a bit nearer to this knowledge
by admitting that whatever the value may be it will be
divided between two persons? Whatever you give to the
labourer is made up of labour and profits, and therefore the
value of labour is constant! This is your proposition. To
me it wants every quality of clearness. I find that at one
time I give a man ten bushels of wheat for the same quantity
of his labour for which at another time I give him eight
bushels. Wheat, according to you, falls in the proportion
of ten to eight. I ask why? And your answer is, because
'as the positive value of the labour worked up in the wages
increases, the positive value of the profits (the other component
part of their whole value) diminishes exactly in the
same degree.' Now does this positive value refer to the same
quantity of wheat? Certainly not, but to two different
quantities, to ten bushels at one time, to eight at another.
You add: 'If these two propositions['] (namely the one I
have just mentioned and the invariability of labour as a
measure of value) 'can properly be considered as having
no connection with each other, I must have quite lost
myself on these subjects, and can hardly hope to show the
connection by anything which I can say further[']. I
hope you do not suspect me of shutting my eyes against
conviction; but, if this proposition is so very clear as it is
to you, I cannot account for my want of power to understand
it. I still think that the invariability of your mea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>sure
is the <i>definition</i> with which you set out, and not the
<i>conclusion</i> to which you arrive by any legitimate argument.
My complaint against you is that you claim to have given
us an accurate measure of value, and I object to your claim,
not that I have succeeded and you have failed, but that we
have both failed, that there is not and cannot be an accurate
measure of value, and that the [most th]at any man can
do is to find out a measure of value applicable in a great
many cases, and not very far deviating from accuracy in
many others. This is all I have pretended to do, or now
pretend to have done; and, if you advanced no higher
claims, I would be more humble; but I cannot allow that
you have succeeded in the great object you aimed at. In
answering you I am really using those weapons by which
alone you say you can be defeated, and which are I confess
equally applicable to your measure and to mine, I mean
the argument of the non-existence of any measure of absolute
value. There is no such thing; your measure as well
as mine will measure variations arising from more or less
labour being required to produce commodities, but the
difficulty is respecting the varying proportions which go to
labour and profits. The alteration in these proportions
alters the relative value of things in the degree that more
or less of labour or profit enters into them; and for these
variations there has never been, and I think never will be,
any perfect measure of value.</p>

<p class="idt">I have only a few words more to say on the subject
of value, and I have done. You cannot avail yourself of
the argument that a foot may measure the variable height
of a man, although the variable height of a man cannot
truly measure the foot, because you have agreed that under
certain circumstances the man's height is not variable, and
it is to those circumstances that I always refer. You say
of my measure, and say truly, that if all commodities were
produced under the same circumstances of time, etc., as
itself, it would be a perfect measure, and you say further
that it is now a perfect measure for all commodities produced
under such circumstances. If then under certain
circumstances mine is a perfect measure, and yours is
always a perfect one, under those circumstances certain
commodities ought to vary in these two measures just in
the same degree. Do they so? Certainly not, then one of
the measures must be imperfect. If they are both perfect
mine ought to measure yours as well as yours mine.</p>

<p>There is no impropriety in your saying with Adam Smith<a name="FNanchor_277_279" id="FNanchor_277_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_279" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
that 'labour will measure not only that part of the whole
value of the commodity which resolves itself into labour,
but also that which resolves itself into profit,' because it is
the fact. But is not this true also of any variable measure
you could fix on? Is it not true of iron, copper, lead, cloth,
corn, etc., etc.? The question is about an invariable measure
of value, and your proof of invariability is that it will
measure profits as well as labour, which every variable
measure will also do.</p>

<p>I have acknowledged that my measure is inaccurate, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
say, I have so; but not because it would not do everything
which you assert your's will do, but because I am not secure
of its invariability. Shrimps are worth &pound;10 in my money;&mdash;it
becomes necessary, we will suppose, in order to improve
the shrimps to keep them one year when profits are 10 per
cent.; shrimps at the end of that time will be worth &pound;11.
They have gained a value of &pound;1. Now where is the difference
whether you value them in labour and say that at
the first period they are worth ten days' labour and subsequently
eleven, or say that at the first period they are
worth &pound;10, subsequently &pound;11?</p>

<p>I am not sure that your language is accurate when you
say that 'labour is the real advance in kind, and profits
may be correctly estimated upon the advances whatever
they may be.' A farmer's capital consists of raw produce,
and his real advances in kind are raw produce. His
advances are worth and can command a certain quantity
of labour undoubtedly, and his profits are nothing
unless the produce he obtains will command more if he
estimates both advances and profits in labour, but so it is
in any other commodity in which he may value his advances
and returns. Does it signify whether it be labour
or any other thing, provided there be no reason to suspect
that it has altered in value? I know that you will say
that provided his produce is sure to command a certain
quantity of labour he is sure of being able to reproduce,
not so if he estimates in any other thing, because that
thing and labour may have undergone a great relative
alteration. But may not the real alteration be in the value
of labour, and, if he act on the presumption of its remaining
at its then rate, may he not be wofully mistaken, and be
a loser instead of a gainer? Your argument always supposes
labour to be of an uniform value, and if we yielded
that point to you there would be no question between us.
A manufacturer who uniformly used no other measure of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
value than that which you recommend would be as infallibly
liable to great disappointments as he is now exposed to
in the vulgar variable medium in which he is accustomed
to estimate value.</p>

<p>And now, my dear Malthus, I have done. Like other
disputants, after much discussion we each retain our own
opinions. These discussions, however, never influence our
friendship; I should not like you more than I do if you
agreed in opinion with me.</p>

<p>Pray give Mrs. Ricardo's and my kind regards to Mrs.
Malthus.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Ricardo died at Gatcomb on 11th Sept., 1823, of an
abscess in the head, which caused great suffering. He was buried
in the vault of a church at Huish, near Chippenham, Wilts; and
his friend Joseph Hume was among the mourners. As he was
only fifty-one years of age, his death was a great shock to his
friends and caused something like dismay among his disciples.
'I never loved anybody out of my own family so much. Our
interchange of opinions was so unreserved, and the object after
which we were both enquiring was so entirely the truth and
nothing else, that I cannot but think we sooner or later must have
agreed.' So said Malthus, in Empson's hearing<a name="FNanchor_278_280" id="FNanchor_278_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_280" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>.</p>

No, but the re-introduction of free trade should be gradual.) It was probably
on such subjects as Tithes and Taxation that he differed most from Ricardo.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
